{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator was used to compare the effectiveness of increasing intensity (looming) auditory warning signals with other types of auditory warnings. BACKGROUND: Auditory warnings have been shown to speed driver reaction time in rear-end collision situations; however, it is not clear which type of signal is the most effective. Although verbal and symbolic (e.g., a car horn) warnings have faster response times than abstract warnings, they often lead to more response errors. METHOD: Participants (N=20) experienced four nonlooming auditory warnings (constant intensity, pulsed, ramped, and car horn), three looming auditory warnings (\"veridical,\" \"early,\" and \"late\"), and a no-warning condition. In 80% of the trials, warnings were activated when a critical response was required, and in 20% of the trials, the warnings were false alarms. For the early (late) looming warnings, the rate of change of intensity signaled a time to collision (TTC) that was shorter (longer) than the actual TTC. RESULTS: Veridical looming and car horn warnings had significantly faster brake reaction times (BRT) compared with the other nonlooming warnings (by 80 to 160 ms). However, the number of braking responses in false alarm conditions was significantly greater for the car horn. BRT increased significantly and systematically as the TTC signaled by the looming warning was changed from early to veridical to late. CONCLUSION: Looming auditory warnings produce the best combination of response speed and accuracy. APPLICATION: The results indicate that looming auditory warnings can be used to effectively warn a driver about an impending collision.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of two physiological measures for discriminating between levels of cognitive demand under driving conditions across different age groups. BACKGROUND: Previous driving research presents a mixed picture concerning the sensitivity of physiological measures for differentiating tasks with presumed differences in mental workload. METHOD: A total of 108 relatively healthy drivers balanced by gender and across three age groups (20-29, 40-49, 60-69) engaged in three difficulty levels of an auditory presentation-verbal response working memory task. RESULTS: Heart rate and skin conductance level (SCL) both increased in a statistically significant fashion with each incremental increase in cognitive demand, whereas driving performance measures did not provide incremental discrimination. SCL was lower in the 40s and 60s age groups; however, the pattern of incremental increase with higher demand was consistent for heart rate and SCL across all age groups. Although each measure was quite sensitive at the group level, considering both SCL and heart rate improved detection of periods of heightened cognitive demand at the individual level. CONCLUSION: The data provide clear evidence that two basic physiological measures can be utilized under field conditions to differentiate multiple levels of objectively defined changes in cognitive demand. Methodological considerations, including task engagement, may account for some of the inconsistencies in previous research. APPLICATION: These findings increase the confidence with which these measures may be applied to assess relative differences in mental workload when developing and optimizing human machine interface (HMI) designs and in exploring their potential role in advanced workload detection and augmented cognition systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined perceived time to collision (TTC) with automobile drivers under realistic approach, rear-end crash scenario conditions. BACKGROUND: TTC refers to the time before impact if prevailing conditions continue. METHOD: In this test track study involving 51 drivers ranging from 20 to 70 years old, the driver's vision was occluded at either 3.6 or 5.6 s TTC during an in-lane approach to a lead vehicle. Drivers provided TTC estimates by pressing a button the instant they felt that they would have collided with the vehicle ahead. RESULTS: Results indicated that TTC was consistently underestimated. The TTC ratio (perceived TTC\/actual TTC) increased as driver speed decreased and as relative speed increased. These ratios were largely unaffected by age, gender, actual TTC, viewing time (1 s vs. continuous), and the presence of an eyes-forward, mental addition distraction task. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that under these low TTC conditions drivers estimate TTC in a relatively uniform fashion and that they are capable of providing this estimate based on a brief glimpse to the vehicle ahead.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Four head-related transfer function (HRTF) data sets were compared to determine the effect of HRTF measurement methodology on the localization of spatialized auditory stimuli. BACKGROUND: Spatial audio interfaces typically require HRTF data sets to generate the spatialized auditory stimuli. HRTF measurement is accomplished using a variety of techniques that can require several nearly arbitrary decisions about methodology. The effects of these choices upon the resulting spatial audio interface are unclear. METHOD: Sixteen participants completed a sound localization task that included real-world, broadband stimuli spatialized at eight locations on the horizontal plane. Four different HRTF data sets were utilized to spatialize the stimuli: two publicly available HRTF data sets and two data sets obtained using different in-house measurement systems. All HRTFs were obtained from the Knowles Electronics Mannequin for Acoustics Research. RESULTS: Unsigned localization error and proportion of front\/back reversals did not differ significantly across HRTF data sets. Poorest accuracy was observed in locations near the medial (front\/back) axis of the listener, mainly because of the relatively large proportions of reversals at these locations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the particular generalized HRTF data set chosen for spatialization is of minimal importance to the localizability of the resulting stimuli. APPLICATION: This result will inform the design of many spatial audio interfaces that are based upon generalized HRTFs, including wayfaring devices, communication systems, and virtual reality systems.

{"abstract":"This study assessed the effects of spatialized sound presentation on a listener's ability to monitor target (T) messages in the presence of competing (C) messages and high-level (110 dB[A]) background noise (BGN). In a simulated military environment, 8 participants wore two-channel, active noise reduction (ANR) equipped helmets and listened to combinations of T and C messages (89 dB[A] at the ear). T messages were presented synchronously with 0, 1, 2, and 3 C messages in four listening modes: (a) BGN + diotic, (b) BGN + dichotic, (c) BGN + spatial audio, and (d) quiet + spatial audio. Best overall performance occurred in the spatialized modes (c and d) and poorest in the diotic mode (a). As expected, speech recognition was better in quiet than in BGN when multiple C messages were present. Findings indicate that message spatialization in acoustic space improves auditory performance during times of heavy message competition, even in high-level noise. The proposed technology has numerous applications, such as multichannel communications in tactical operations centers, monitoring of complex security systems, and air traffic control.

In this paper we investigate the changes in driver behavior patterns compared with patterns of traditional vehicles with combustion engines after having acquired the necessary adjustments needed for driving an electric vehicle. We aim to expound upon the differences present in driving habits after the individual has become adjusted to the driving patterns of an electric vehicle. RESULTS showed that there is a significant difference in the driving habits of an internal combustion vehicle and that of an electric vehicle. Particularly a development from stronger accelerating and decelerating within the first experiences with electric vehicles to a more calm driving after 5 months of experience was noticeable in acceleration and braking maneuvers. Additionally, results for constant driving proved that interaction with electric vehicles with one-pedal driving capability is not a barrier for efficient driving with constant velocity.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The effects of a forward collision warning (FCW) and braking system (FCW+) were examined in a driving simulator study analyzing driving and gaze behavior and the engagement in a secondary task. BACKGROUND: In-depth accident analyses indicate that a lack of appropriate expectations for possible critical situations and visual distraction may be the major causes of rear-end crashes. Studies with FCW systems have shown that a warning alone was not enough for a driver to be able to avoid the accident. Thus,an additional braking intervention by such systems could be necessary. METHOD: In a driving simulator experiment, 30 drivers took part in a car-following scenario in an urban area. It was assumed that different lead car behaviors and environmental aspects would lead to different drivers' expectations of the future traffic situation. Driving with and without FCW+ was introduced as a between-subjects factor. RESULTS: Driving with FCW+ resulted in significantly fewer accidents in critical situations. This result was achieved by the system's earlier reaction time as compared with that of drivers. The analysis of the gaze behavior showed that driving with the system did not lead to a stronger involvement in secondary tasks. CONCLUSION: The study supports the hypotheses about the importance of missing expectations for the occurrence of accidents. These accidents can be prevented by an FCW+ that brakes autonomously. APPLICATION: The results indicate that an autonomous braking intervention should be implemented in FCW systems to increase the effectiveness of these assistance systems.

{"abstract":"We present a method for automatically identifying and validating predictive relationships between the visual appearance of a city and its non-visual attributes (e.g. crime statistics, housing prices, population density etc.). Given a set of street-level images and (location, city-attribute-value) pairs of measurements, we first identify visual elements in the images that are discriminative of the attribute. We then train a predictor by learning a set of weights over these elements using non-linear Support Vector Regression. To perform these operations efficiently, we implement a scalable distributed processing framework that speeds up the main computational bottleneck (extracting visual elements) by an order of magnitude. This speedup allows us to investigate a variety of city attributes across 6 different American cities. We find that indeed there is a predictive relationship between visual elements and a number of city attributes including violent crime rates, theft rates, housing prices, population density, tree presence, graffiti presence, and the perception of danger. We also test human performance for predicting theft based on street-level images and show that our predictor outperforms this baseline with 33% higher accuracy on average. Finally, we present three prototype applications that use our system to (1) define the visual boundary of city neighborhoods, (2) generate walking directions that avoid or seek out exposure to city attributes, and (3) validate user-specified visual elements for prediction.

{"abstract":"Loneliness is a common condition in elderly associated with severe health consequences including increased mortality, decreased cognitive function, and poor quality of life. Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important-especially in the home setting-as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression. Our approach was both sensitive (0.939) and specific (0.975) in detecting time out-of-home across over 41 000 epochs of data collected from four subjects monitored for at least 30 days each in their own homes. In addition to linking time spent out-of-home to loneliness, (r = -0.44, p = 0.011) as measured by the UCLA Loneliness Index, we demonstrate its usefulness in other applications such as uncovering general behavioral patterns of elderly and exploring the link between time spent out-of-home and physical activity ( r = 0.415, p = 0.031), as measured by the Berkman Social Disengagement Index.

{"abstract":"Evidence exists that virtual worlds reduce pain perception by providing distraction. However, there is no experimental study to show that the type of world used in virtual reality (VR) distraction influences pain perception. Therefore, we investigated whether pain triggered by heat or cold stimuli is modulated by \"warm \"or \"cold \" virtual environments and whether virtual worlds reduce pain perception more than does static picture presentation. We expected that cold worlds would reduce pain perception from heat stimuli, while warm environments would reduce pain perception from cold stimuli. Additionally, both virtual worlds should reduce pain perception in general. Heat and cold pain stimuli thresholds were assessed outside VR in 48 volunteers in a balanced crossover design. Participants completed three 4-minute assessment periods: virtual \"walks \" through (1) a winter and (2) an autumn landscape and static exposure to (3) a neutral landscape. During each period, five heat stimuli or three cold stimuli were delivered via a thermode on the participant's arm, and affective and sensory pain perceptions were rated. Then the thermode was changed to the other arm, and the procedure was repeated with the opposite pain stimuli (heat or cold). We found that both warm and cold virtual environments reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness for heat and cold pain stimuli when compared to the control condition. Since participants wore a head-mounted display (HMD) in both the control condition and VR, we concluded that the distracting value of virtual environments is not explained solely by excluding perception of the real world. Although VR reduced pain unpleasantness, we found no difference in efficacy between the types of virtual world used for each pain stimulus.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the decision times for left-right decisions for a dual-coded advisory turn indicator and a typical spatial-only turn indicator in a GPS navigational map display. BACKGROUND: Track-up maps are useful for turn decision making but do not facilitate configural knowledge acquisition of an area. North-up maps present a stable orientation for this type of learning, but typical implementations of north-up map displays lead to misaligned and confusing turn information. We compared a typical spatial-only indicator with a dual-coded spatial-plus-verbal indicator, systematically manipulating vehicle heading and measuring reaction time. The new display, the Dual-Coded Advisory Turn Indicator for Maps (DATIM), was based on an assumption of the advantages of concurrent verbal and spatial processing of advisory turn indicators in map displays. METHOD: The experimental design was a 2 x 2 x 24 mixed design with indicator type as a between-subjects factor and turn direction (left, right) and 24 heading angles (15 degrees intervals) as repeated-measures factors. Participants made turn decisions while viewing static displays of intersections at variably rotated headings. RESULTS: Reaction time for the DATIM display was consistently faster than the typical spatial-only indicator at all heading angles but especially at heading angles beyond +\/- 45 degrees (520-ms difference at 180 degrees). CONCLUSION: The DATIM display produced faster turn decisions at all heading angles. APPLICATION: DATIM displays could allow north-up maps to be used for turn-by-turn decision making in GPS navigational systems. Drivers could have the advantages of both the stable orientation to facilitate planning and the easy turn-by-turn guidance. Limitations are discussed. Language: en","authors":["Caitlan A.

{"abstract":"Successful behavior requires a finely-tuned interplay of initiating and inhibiting motor programs to react effectively to constantly changing environmental demands. One particularly useful paradigm for investigating inhibitory motor control is the Stop-signal task, where already-initiated responses to Go-stimuli are to be inhibited upon the rapid subsequent presentation of a Stop-stimulus (yielding successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials). Despite the extensive use of this paradigm in functional neuroimaging, there is no consensus on which functional comparison to use to characterize response-inhibition-related brain activity. Here, we utilize conjunction analyses of successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials that are each contrasted against a reference condition. This conjunction approach identifies processes common to both Stop-trial types while excluding processes specific to either, thereby capitalizing on the presence of some response-inhibition-related activity in both conditions. Using this approach on fMRI data from human subjects, we identify a network of brain structures that was linked to both types of Stop-trials, including lateral-inferior-frontal and medial-frontal cortical areas and the caudate nucleus. In addition, comparisons with a reference condition matched for visual stimulation identified additional activity in the right inferior parietal cortex that may play a role in enhancing the processing of the Stop-stimuli. Finally, differences in stopping efficacy across subjects were associated with variations in activity in the left anterior insula. However, this region was also associated with general task accuracy (which furthermore correlated directly with stopping efficacy), suggesting that it might actually reflect a more general mechanism of performance control that supports response inhibition in a relatively nonspecific way.

The two errors are incorrect advice, triggering the automation bias, and missing advice, reflecting complacency. BACKGROUND: Contrasts between analogous automation errors in alerting systems, rather than decision aiding, have revealed that alerting false alarms are more problematic to HAI than alerting misses are. Prior research in decision aiding, although contrasting the two aiding errors (incorrect vs. missing), has confounded error expectancy. METHOD: Participants performed an environmental process control simulation with and without decision aiding. For those with the aid, automation dependence was created through several trials of perfect aiding performance, and an unexpected automation error was then imposed in which automation was either gone (one group) or wrong (a second group). A control group received no automation support. RESULTS: The correct aid supported faster and more accurate diagnosis and lower workload. The aid failure degraded all three variables, but \"automation wrong\" had a much greater effect on accuracy, reflecting the automation bias, than did \"automation gone,\" reflecting the impact of complacency. Some complacency was manifested for automation gone, by a longer latency and more modest reduction in accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Automation wrong, creating the automation bias, appears to be a more problematic form of automation error than automation gone, reflecting complacency. IMPLICATIONS: Decision-aiding automation should indicate its lower degree of confidence in uncertain environments to avoid the automation bias. Language: en","authors":["Christopher D.

{"abstract":"This work is part of the development of a remote home healthcare monitoring application designed to detect distress situations through several types of sensors. The multi-sensor fusion can provide more accurate and reliable information compared to information provided by each sensor separately. Furthermore, data from multiple heterogeneous sensors present in the remote home healthcare monitoring systems have different degrees of imperfection and trust. Among the multi-sensor fusion methods, Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is currently considered the most appropriate for representing and processing the imperfect information. Based on a graphical representation of the DST called Evidential Networks, a structure of heterogeneous data fusion from multiple sensors for fall detection has been proposed. The Evidential Networks, implemented on our remote medical monitoring platform, are also proposed in this work to maximize the performance of automatic fall detection and thus make the system more reliable. However, the presence of noise, the variability of recorded signals by the sensors and the failing or unreliable sensors may thwart the Evidential Networks performance. In addition, the sensors signals non-stationary nature may degrade the experimental conditions. To compensate the non-stationary effect, the time evolution is consider by introducing the Dynamic Evidential Networks which was evaluated by the simulated fall scenarios corresponding to various use cases.

{"abstract":"Deficits in response inhibition and heightened impulsivity have been linked to psychiatric disorders and aggression. They have been investigated in clinical groups as well as individuals with trait characteristics, yielding insights into the underlying neural and behavioral mechanisms of response inhibition and impulsivity. The motor inhibition tasks employed in most studies, however, have lacked an emotional component, which is crucial given that both response inhibition and impulsivity attain salience within a socio-emotional context. For this fMRI study, we selected a group with high trait aggression (HA, n=17) and one with low trait aggression (LA, n=16) from 550 males who had completed an Aggression Questionnaire. Neural activation was compared to an emotional version (including angry and neutral faces) of the stop signal task. Behavioral results revealed impaired response inhibition in HA, associated with higher motor impulsivity. This was accompanied by attenuated activation in brain regions involved in response inhibition, including the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and motor cortex. Together, these findings offer evidence that a reduced inhibition capacity is present in HA. Notably, response inhibition improved during anger trials in both groups, suggesting a facilitation effect through heightened activation in the related brain regions. In both groups, inclusion of the anger stimuli enhanced activation of the motor and somatosensory areas, which modulate executive control, and of limbic regions including the amygdala. In summary, the investigation of response inhibition in individuals with high and low trait characteristics affords useful insights into the underlying distinct processing mechanisms. It can contribute to the investigation of trait markers in a clinical context without having to deal with the complex mechanisms of a clinical disorder itself. In contrast, the mechanisms of emotional response inhibition did not differ between groups. Hence, the specific emotional influence is not interacting with trait aggression.

{"abstract":"This paper proposes a new theory to account for the effects of underload on performance. Malleable attentional resources theory posits that attentional capacity can change size in response to changes in task demands. As such, the performance decrements associated with mental underload can be explained by a lack of appropriate attentional resources. These proposals were explored in a driving simulator experiment. Vehicle automation was manipulated at 4 levels, and mental workload was assessed with a secondary task. Eye movements were also recorded to determine whether attentional capacity varied with mental workload. The results showed a clear decrease in mental workload associated with some levels of automation. Most striking, though, were the results derived from the eye movement recordings, which demonstrated that attentional capacity varies directly with level of mental workload. These data fully supported the predictions of the new theory. Malleable attentional resources theory suggests that future vehicle designers should employ their technology in driver support systems rather than in automation to replace the driver. The implications of this theory are discussed with regard to capacity models of attention as well as to the design of future vehicle systems. Language: en","authors":["Mark S. Young","Neville A.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Payoff effects on strategy development and change were assessed in a synthetic work environment, SYNWORK1. BACKGROUND: Many work settings require several tasks to be performed concurrently. It is important to know how the strategies used in performing the respective tasks vary with payoffs. METHOD: Sixty students performed four tasks in SYNWORK1, for which points are received for correct responses and lost for incorrect responses. Individual-task payoffs were varied between participants and were changed after 8 and 12 sessions to examine the effects of a previous strategy on development of a new strategy. RESULTS: Participants were sensitive to initial payoffs and modified their strategies when payoffs changed. However, residual effects of prior payoffs were evident. CONCLUSION: Payoffs for multiple-task environments need to be explicit, and practice should be provided for strategy development. When payoffs change, strategies adopted reflect current and previous payoffs. APPLICATION: The findings can be applied to the design of payoff schedules for multiple-task environments.

{"abstract":"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been one of the \"signature injuries\" of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, neuroimaging studies in concussive 'mild' blast-related TBI have been challenging due to the absence of abnormalities in computed tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the heterogeneity of the blast-related injury mechanisms. The goal of this study was to address these challenges utilizing single-subject, module-based graph theoretic analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. We acquired 20min of resting-state fMRI in 63 U.S. military personnel clinically diagnosed with concussive blast-related TBI and 21 U.S. military controls who had blast exposures but no diagnosis of TBI. All subjects underwent an initial scan within 90days post-injury and 65 subjects underwent a follow-up scan 6 to 12months later. A second independent cohort of 40 U.S. military personnel with concussive blast-related TBI served as a validation dataset. The second independent cohort underwent an initial scan within 30days post-injury. 75% of the scans were of good quality, with exclusions primarily due to excessive subject motion. Network analysis of the subset of these subjects in the first cohort with good quality scans revealed spatially localized reductions in the participation coefficient, a measure of between-module connectivity, in the TBI patients relative to the controls at the time of the initial scan. These group differences were less prominent on the follow-up scans. The 15 brain areas with the most prominent reductions in the participation coefficient were next used as regions of interest (ROIs) for single-subject analyses. In the first TBI cohort, more subjects than would be expected by chance (27\/47 versus 2\/47 expected, p Language: en","authors":["Kihwan Han","Christine L. Mac Donald","Ann M.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 30 hr of sleep loss and continuous cognitive work on performance in a distributed team decision-making environment. BACKGROUND: To date, only a few studies have examined the effect of sleep loss on distributed team performance, and only one other to our knowledge has examined the relationship between sleep loss and social-motivational aspects of teams (Hoeksema-van Orden, Gaillard, & Buunk, 1998). METHOD: Sixteen teams participated; each comprised 4 members. Three team members made threat assessments on a military surveillance task and then forwarded their judgments electronically to a team leader, who made a final assessment on behalf of the team. RESULTS: Sleep loss had an antagonistic effect on team decision-making accuracy and decision time. However, the performance loss associated with fatigue attributable to sleep loss was mediated by being part of a team, as compared with performing the same task individually - that is, we found evidence of a \"motivational gain\" effect in these sleepy teams. We compare these results with those of Hoeksema-van Orden et al. (1998), who found clear evidence of a \"social loafing\" effect in sleepy teams. CONCLUSION: The divergent results are discussed in the context of the collective effort model (Karau & Williams, 1993) and are attributable in part to a difference between independent and interdependent team tasks.

{"abstract":"The development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) will be a crucial element in the construction of future intelligent transportation systems with the objective of reducing the number of traffic accidents and their subsequent fatalities. Specifically, driving behaviors could be monitored online to determine the crash risk and provide warning information to the driver via their ADAS. In this paper, we focus on aggressiveness as one of the potential causes of traffic accidents. We demonstrate that aggressiveness can be detected by monitoring external driving signals such as lateral and longitudinal accelerations and speed. We model aggressiveness as a linear filter operating on these signals, thus scaling their probability distribution functions and modifying their mean value, standard deviation, and dynamic range. Next, we proceed to validate this model via an experiment, conducted under real driving conditions, involving ten different drivers, traveling a route with five different types of road sections, subject to both smooth and aggressive behaviors. The obtained results confirm the validity of the model of aggressiveness. In addition, they show the generality of this model and its applicability to specific driving signals (speed, longitudinal, and lateral accelerations), every single driver, and every road type. Finally, we build a classifier capable of detecting aggressive behavior from the driving signal. This classifier achieves a success rate up to 92%.

Themes related to publicity, anonymity of perpetrators, features of the medium, presence of bystanders, and individual level factors were identified as potential influences upon impact severity.

{"abstract":"Processing evidence that disconfirms a prior interpretation is a fundamental aspect of belief revision, and has clear social and clinical relevance. This complex cognitive process requires (at minimum) an alerting stage and an integration stage, and in the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used multivariate analysis methodology on two datasets in an attempt to separate these sequentially-activated cognitive stages and link them to distinct functional brain networks. Thirty-nine healthy participants completed one of two versions of an evidence integration experiment involving rating two consecutive animal images, both of which consisted of two intact images of animal faces morphed together at different ratios (e.g., 70\/30 bird\/dolphin followed by 10\/90 bird\/dolphin). The two versions of the experiment differed primarily in terms of stimulus presentation and timing, which facilitated functional interpretation of brain networks based on differences in the hemodynamic response shapes between versions. The data were analyzed using constrained principal component analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA), which allows distinct, simultaneously active task-based networks to be separated, and these were interpreted using both temporal (task-based hemodynamic response shapes) and spatial (dominant brain regions) information. Three networks showed increased activity during integration of disconfirmatory relative to confirmatory evidence: (1) a network involved in alerting to the requirement to revise an interpretation, identified as the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula); (2) a sensorimotor response-related network (pre- and post-central gyri, supplementary motor area, and thalamus); and (3) an integration network involving rostral prefrontal, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortex. These three networks were staggered in their peak activity (alerting, responding, then integrating), but at certain time points (e.g., 17seconds after trial onset) the hemodynamic responses associated with all three networks were simultaneously active. These findings highlight distinct cognitive processes and corresponding functional brain networks underlying stages of disconfirmatory evidence integration, and demonstrate the power of multivariate and multi-experiment methodology in cognitive neuroscience.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of workload history (specifically, sudden shifts in workload) on performance. BACKGROUND: In 1993 the National Research Council identified workload transition as an important concern for human factors researchers. The study of workload history suggests that what an individual has been doing prior to a point in time has an effect on subsequent performance. One trend emerging from workload history studies is that a general decrement in performance is most likely to occur following a decrease in task demand. METHOD: The 198 participants were randomly assigned to a high-to-low or low-to-high condition. Participants performed a version of the Bakan Vigilance Task while correct responses, response times, and total errors were recorded. RESULTS: Results supported previous research suggesting a workload decrease results in a performance decrement. More importantly, this study reports that either a sudden increase or decrease could lead to a loss in accuracy and a slowing of response time in a longer time course. CONCLUSION: An explanation of the decrement is offered in terms of adaptation models. In addition, a follow-up study suggested that the decrement is a result of something inherent in the workload shift rather than an effect of fatigue.

These implications are particularly salient in occupations where individuals are confronted with varying levels of workload demand, especially safety-sensitive occupations.

Interviewed non-injured school children were separated into non-overlapping groups of risky behavior. Data on interviewed non-injured and non-interviewed injured children were put into a linear system of equations consisting of a 4 x 3 matrix scheme. Each equation represents children of the same age and sex and consists of the percentage of interviewed children grouped into high medium or low risk behavior and of the percentage of injured children. Four methods of calculating the matrix system were evaluated and the best implemented as a new developed computer program. The resulting linear group risk factors enable the prediction of behavior outcome. Data on interviewed injured children were compared with the results obtained. The validation procedure is proposed by testing the sensitivity and robustness of the method.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: It was investigated how speed limit repetition and distraction affect drivers' speed management throughout a road section where the imposed speed limit is not in accordance (too low) with road design. BACKGROUND: It is not clear how driving speed evolves and to what degree speed limit repetition is necessary on roads where the imposed speed limit is not in accordance (too low) with road design. It is furthermore of interest how all these factors are influenced by driver distraction. METHOD: In a driving simulator, 47 volunteers completed one trip with and without distraction. Within each trip, three configurations were presented: speed limit sign repetition after every intersection, repetition only in the middle of a segment, or no repetition. RESULTS: Distraction lowered driving speed. Speed management varied depending on speed limit repetition. The speed limit was exceeded more often when speed limit signs were repeated less frequently. When drivers were not reminded of the limit, speed linearly increased throughout the segment. In all three configurations, speed increased toward the end of the segment, but this increase was largest when there had been no repetition at all of the speed limit. CONCLUSION: In low-demanding road designs that allow drivers to exceed the speed limit, limit repetition is necessary. Frequent repetition may be preferred, as speed management was most homogenous in that case. APPLICATION: The proposed analysis of speed management throughout a section increases our understanding of how speed evolves and thereby shows where repetition of the speed limit is necessary.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a time-efficient method, based on an adaptive psychophysical technique, to reliably determine the boundary of the conspicuity area. Because full-field mapping is time consuming, estimating the boundary from only a limited amount of target presentations is attractive. BACKGROUND: Detectability of visual targets can be evaluated by measuring their associated conspicuity areas. Earlier literature reported elliptical conspicuity areas, but later research that found shape irregularities brought into question the validity of using techniques based on this assumption to approach the area's boundary. METHOD: Eight participants were required to view briefly presented target-background combinations, with successive target positions depending on preceding observer responses. RESULTS: Nonlinear least squares curve fitting showed conspicuity areas to be elliptical. Results from response time (RT) studies supported the finding, showing that slopes of RT versus eccentricity functions were markedly steeper at positions outside the conspicuity area than at those within. CONCLUSION: It is proposed that the developed method provides a time-efficient and accurate means to measure the conspicuity area. APPLICATION: The findings are applicable to industries in which target detectability needs to be assessed in order to either reduce (e.g., for camouflage) or enhance detectability (e.g., road safety).

{"abstract":"This study investigated human-machine cooperation when driving with different degrees of a shared control system. By means of a direct intervention on the steering wheel, shared control systems partially correct the vehicle's trajectory and, at the same time, provide continuous haptic guidance to the driver. A crucial point is to determine the optimal level of steering assistance for effective cooperation between the two agents. Five system settings were compared with a condition in which no assistance was present. In addition, road visibility was manipulated by means of additional fog or self-controlled visual occlusions. Several performance indicators and subjective assessments were analyzed. The results show that the best repartition of control in terms of cooperation between human and machine can be identified through an analysis of the steering wheel reversal rate, the steering effort and the mean lateral position of the vehicle. The best cooperation was achieved with systems of relatively low-level haptic authority, although more intervention may be preferable in poor visibility conditions. Increasing haptic authority did not yield higher benefits in terms of steering behavior, visual demand or subjective feeling.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments are described that examined operators' perceptions of decision aids. BACKGROUND: Research has suggested certain biases against automation that influence human interaction with automation. We differentiated preconceived biases from post hoc biases and examined their effects on advice acceptance. METHOD: In Study 1 we examined operators' trust in and perceived reliability of humans versus automation of varying pedigree (expert vs. novice), based on written descriptions of these advisers prior to operators' interacting with these advisers. In Study 2 we examined participants' post hoc trust in, perceived reliability of, and dependence on these advisers after their objective experience of advisers' reliability (90% vs. 70%) in a luggage-screening task. RESULTS: In Study 1 measures of perceived reliability indicated that automation was perceived as more reliable than humans across pedigrees. Measures of trust indicated that automated \"novices\" were trusted more than human \"novices\"; human \"experts\" were trusted more than automated \"experts.\" In Study 2, perceived reliability varied as a function of pedigree, whereas subjective trust was always higher for automation than for humans. Advice acceptance from novice automation was always higher than from novice humans. However, when advisers were 70% reliable, errors generated by expert automation led to a drop in compliance\/reliance on expert automation relative to expert humans. CONCLUSION: Preconceived expectations of automation influence the use of these aids in actual tasks. APPLICATION: The results provide a reference point for deriving indices of \"optimal\" user interaction with decision aids and for developing frameworks of trust in decision support systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of proximity and time pressure on accurate and effective visual search during medication selection from a computer screen. BACKGROUND: The presence of multiple similar objects in proximity to a target object increases the difficulty of a visual search. Visual similarity between drug names can also lead to selection error. The proximity of several similarly named drugs within a visual field could, therefore, adversely affect visual search. METHOD: In Study 1, 60 nonpharmacy participants selected a target drug name from an array of mock drug packets shown on a computer screen, where one or four similarly named nontargets might be present. Of the participants, 30 completed the task with a time constraint, and the remainder did not. In Study 2, the same experiment was repeated with 28 pharmacy staff. RESULTS: In Study 1, the proximity of multiple similarly named nontargets within the specified visual field reduced selection accuracy and increased reaction times in the nonpharmacists. Time constraint also had an adverse effect. In Study 2, the pharmacy participants showed increased reaction times when multiple nontargets were present, but the time constraint had no effect. There was no effect of Tall Man lettering. CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple similarly named medications in close proximity to a target medication increases the difficulty of the visual search for the target. Tall Man lettering has no impact on this adverse effect.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to investigate potential benefits of likelihood alarm systems (LASs) over binary alarm systems (BASs) in a multitask environment. BACKGROUND: Several problems are associated with the use of BASs, because most of them generate high numbers of false alarms. Operators lose trust in the systems and ignore alarms or cross-check all of them when other information is available. The first behavior harms safety, whereas the latter one reduces productivity. LASs represent an alternative, which is supposed to improve operators' attention allocation. METHOD: We investigated LASs and BASs in a dual-task paradigm with and without the possibility to cross-check alerts with raw data information. Participants' trust in the system, their behavior, and their performance in the alert and the concurrent task were assessed. RESULTS: Reported trust, compliance with alarms, and performance in the alert and the concurrent task were higher for the LAS than for the BAS. The cross-check option led to an increase in alert task performance for both systems and a decrease in concurrent task performance for the BAS, which did not occur in the LAS condition. CONCLUSION: LASs improve participants' attention allocation between two different tasks and therefore lead to an increase in alert task and concurrent task performance. The performance maximum is achieved when LAS is combined with a cross-check option for validating alerts with additional information. APPLICATION: The use of LASs instead of BASs in safety-related multitask environments has the potential to increase safety and productivity likewise.

{"abstract":"In recent years, many accident models and techniques have shifted their focus from shortfalls in the actions of practitioners to systemic causes in the organization. Accident investigation techniques (e.g., STAMP) have been developed that looked into the flaws of control processes in the organization. Organizational models have looked into general patterns of breakdown related to structural vulnerabilities and gradual degradation of performance. Although some degree of cross-fertilization has been developed between these two trends, safety analysts are left on their own to integrate this gap between control flaws and patterns of organizational breakdown in accident investigation. This article attempts to elaborate the control dynamics of the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) technique on the basis of a theoretical model of organizational viability (i.e., the Viable Systems Model). The joint STAMP-VSM framework is applied to an accident from a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) organization to help analysts progress from the analysis of control flaws to the underlying patterns of breakdown. The joint framework may help analysts to rethink the safety organization, model new information loops and constraints, look at the adaptation and steering functions of the organization and finally, develop high leverage interventions.

{"abstract":"Efficient emotion regulation is essential for social interaction and functioning in human society and often happens without direct intention and conscious awareness. Cognitive labeling of stimuli based on certain characteristics has been assumed to represent an effective strategy of implicit emotional regulation whereas processing based on simple perceptual characteristics (e.g., matching) has not. Evidence exists that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) might be of functional relevance during labeling by down-regulating limbic activity in the presence of threatening stimuli. However, it remained unclear whether this VLPFC activation was particularly specific to threat because previous studies focused exclusively on threatening stimuli. In the current study, 35 healthy participants labeled or matched both threatening and neutral pictures while undergoing 52-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed increased VLPFC activation during labeling of threatening but not neutral pictures. No increase in prefrontal activation was detected during matching. Moreover, skin conductance increased equally for both valence conditions during initial phases of labeling whereas during matching stronger increases were found for threatening stimuli. Although a general inverse relationship between VLPFC function and skin conductance was not confirmed, both were negatively correlated during matching of threatening pictures in subjects with high state anxiety. It was concluded that the VLPFC plays an essential role during implicit emotion regulation. Further, even simple perceptual processing seems to engage regulatory top-down activation in anxious individuals. Language: en","authors":["Sara V.

{"abstract":"A class of networks are those with both positive and negative links. In this manuscript, we studied the interplay between positive and negative ties on mesoscopic level of these networks, i.e., their community structure. A community is considered as a tightly interconnected group of actors; therefore, it does not borrow any assumption from balance theory and merely uses the well-known assumption in the community detection literature. We found that if one detects the communities based on only positive relations (by ignoring the negative ones), the majority of negative relations are already placed between the communities. In other words, negative ties do not have a major role in community formation of signed networks. Moreover, regarding the internal negative ties, we proved that most unbalanced communities are maximally balanced, and hence they cannot be partitioned into k nonempty sub-clusters with higher balancedness (k\u22652). Furthermore, we showed that although the mediator triad ++- (hostile-mediator-hostile) is underrepresented, it constitutes a considerable portion of triadic relations among communities. Hence, mediator triads should not be ignored by community detection and clustering algorithms. As a result, if one uses a clustering algorithm that operates merely based on social balance, mesoscopic structure of signed networks significantly remains hidden.

{"abstract":"Motivation Road traffic accidents are among the top leading causes of deaths and injuries of various levels in South Africa. With the wealth and huge amount of data generated from road traffic accidents, the issue of traffic accident prediction has become a central challenge in the field of transportation data analysis. Such accident prediction is designed to detect patterns involved in dangerous crashes and thus help decision making and planning before casualty and loss occur. Recently, numerous researchers have presented a wide range of prediction techniques. Most of these methods are based on statistical studies but usually fail to explain the insights of prediction results. This has led to the development and application of supervised learning algorithms (classifiers) in an attempt to provide more accurate accident prediction in terms of injury severity (fatal\/serious\/slight\/property damage with no injury). Even then, the task of learning an accurate classifier from instances raises a number of new issues some of which have not been properly addressed by transportation research. Thus, an effective prediction method is required for improving predictive accuracy. RESULTS The essence of the paper is the proposal that prediction of accidents given poor data quality (in terms of incomplete data) can be improved by using a classifier based on grey relational analysis, a similarity-based method. We evaluate the grey relational classifier with other state-of-the-art classifiers including artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbour, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifier, algorithm quasi-optimal and support vector machines. Real-world road traffic accident dataset is utilized for this task. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the grey relational classifier algorithm in terms of road traffic accident predictive accuracy. 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate prevalence based on variations in case definitions used for epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). BACKGROUND: Prior studies of MSDs have mostly relied on a single case definition based on questionnaires. METHOD: In a multicenter prospective cohort study, we systematically collected data to evaluate impacts of differences in case definitions of MSDs on prevalence of three common musculoskeletal disorders: (a) shoulder tendinosis, (b) lateral epicondylalgia, and (c) carpal tunnel syndrome. Production workers were from 21 employment settings in three diverse U.S. states and performed widely varying work. All workers completed laptop-administered structured interviews, two standardized physical examinations, and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Case definitions included symptoms only, and symptoms plus physical examinations and\/or NCS. RESULTS: A total of 1,227 subjects had complete health data at baseline. The prevalence for shoulder tendinosis is 23.0% if only glenohumeral pain is used for a case definition, compared with 8.0% if a combination of pain plus a positive supraspinatus test is used. The prevalence for lateral epicondylalgia varied on the basis of lateral elbow pain (12.0%), pain plus tenderness on palpation (9.9%), or pain plus tenderness on palpation plus resisted wrist or middle finger extension (3.5%). Carpal tunnel syndrome prevalence varied on the basis of tingling or numbness in a median nerve-served digit (29.9%) or tingling or numbness plus NCS abnormalities consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (9.0%). CONCLUSION: Variations in epidemiological case definitions have major impacts on prevalence of common MSDs.

{"abstract":"Human mobility has been empirically observed to exhibit Levy flight characteristics and behaviour with power-law distributed jump size. The fundamental mechanisms behind this behaviour has not yet been fully explained. In this paper, we propose to explain the Levy walk behaviour observed in human mobility patterns by decomposing them into different classes according to the different transportation modes, such as Walk\/Run, Bike, Train\/Subway or Car\/Taxi\/Bus. Our analysis is based on two real-life GPS datasets containing approximately 10 and 20 million GPS samples with transportation mode information. We show that human mobility can be modelled as a mixture of different transportation modes, and that these single movement patterns can be approximated by a lognormal distribution rather than a power-law distribution. Then, we demonstrate that the mixture of the decomposed lognormal flight distributions associated with each modality is a power-law distribution, providing an explanation to the emergence of Levy Walk patterns that characterize human mobility patterns.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effects of active training on older drivers' scanning in intersections, the present article reports the results of a 2-year followup with drivers who had previously participated the older driver training study reported in Romoser and Fisher. BACKGROUND: Customized feedback coupled with active learning in a simulator has been shown to be an effective means of significantly improving the intersection scanning behavior of older drivers. However, the long-term effect of such training has not been established. METHOD: Older drivers from the active learning and control groups from Romoser and Fisher were invited to participate in a 2-year follow-up field drive in their own vehicle starting at their home. Secondary looks, defined as looking away from the path of the vehicle while entering the intersections toward regions to the side from which other vehicles could appear, were recorded. RESULTS: Two years after their training, older drivers in the active learning group still took secondary looks more than one and a half times as often as 2009 pretraining levels. Control group drivers saw no significant change in performance over the 2-year period. CONCLUSION: Customized feedback and active learning in a simulator is an effective strategy for improving the safe driving habits of older drivers over the long term. It provides drivers a means by which to reincorporate previously extinguished behaviors into their driving habits. APPLICATION: These results can guide the development of older driver retraining programs that could have the potential to reduce intersection crashes. Language: en","authors":["Matthew R. E.

{"abstract":"The first moments at a disater scene are chaotic. The command center initially operates with little knowledge of hazards, geography and casualties, building up knowledge of the event slowly as information trickles in by voice radio channels. RealityFlythrough is a tele-presence system that stitches together live video feeds in real-time, using the principle of visual closure, to give command center personnel the illustion of being able to explore the scene interactively by moving smoothly between the video feeds. Using RealityFlythrough, medical, fire, law enforcement, hazardous materials, and engineering experts may be able to achieve situational awareness earlier, and better manage scarce resources. The RealityFlythrough system is composed of camera units with off-the-shelf GPS and orientation systems and a server\/viewing station that offers access to images collected by the camera units in real time by position\/orientation. In initial field testing using an experimental mesh 802.11 wireless network, two camera unit operators were able to create an interactive image of a simulated disaster scene in about five minutes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments examined the detectability of transient changes in cluttered and dynamic displays and optimal scan strategies for performance. BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that onset changes are prioritized by the attention system and onsets are often used to signal important display changes. However, research has mostly used uncluttered, static displays and has largely ignored the role of scan strategy. METHOD: We had participants monitor a cluttered and dynamic display and respond when an object changed color or onset abruptly. Scan strategies were also evaluated. In another experiment participants were instructed to use particular strategies to detect changes. RESULTS: Consistent with previous results, onset events were detected better than were color change events. Scan strategy accounted for a large proportion of variance in detection performance. Participants who made few eye movements performed best. Participants who actively scanned the display performed worst. When poor performers were instructed to make few eye movements, their performance matched that of the best performers. CONCLUSION: Onset alerts can be an effective means of signaling important events in complex displays. Additionally, scan strategy plays an important role in the detection of transient events.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we tested to what extent highly automated convoy driving involving small spacing (\"platooning\") may affect time headway (THW) and standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) during subsequent manual driving. BACKGROUND: Although many previous studies have reported beneficial effects of automated driving, some research has also highlighted potential drawbacks, such as increased speed and reduced THW during the activation of semiautomated driving systems. Here, we rather focused on the question of whether switching from automated to manual driving may produce unwanted carryover effects on safety-relevant driving performance. METHOD: We utilized a pre-post simulator design to measure THW and SDLP after highly automated driving and compared the data with those for a control group (manual driving throughout). RESULTS: Our data revealed that THW was reduced and SDLP increased after leaving the automation mode. A closer inspection of the data suggested that specifically the effect on THW is likely due to sensory and\/or cognitive adaptation processes. CONCLUSION: Behavioral adaptation effects need to be taken into account in future implementations of automated convoy systems. APPLICATION: Potential application areas of this research comprise automated freight traffic (truck convoys) and the design of driver assistance systems in general. Potential countermeasures against following at short distance as behavioral adaptation should be considered.

{"abstract":"Previous research has shown that personality characteristics, such as sensation seeking (SS), are strong predictors of risk-taking behavior during adolescence. However, the relationship between levels of SS and brain response has not been studied during this time period. Given the prevalence of risky behavior during adolescence, it is important to understand neurobiological differences in reward sensitivity between youth with high and low SS personalities. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine differences in brain activity in an adolescent sample that included 27 high (HSS) and 27 low sensation seekers (LSS), defined by the Impulsive Sensation Seeking scale of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman et al., 1993). In the scanner, participants played a modified Wheel of Fortune decision-making task (Cservenka and Nagel, 2012) that resulted in trials with monetary Wins or No Wins. We compared age- and sex-matched adolescent HSS and LSS (mean age = 13.94 \u00b1 1.05) on brain activity by contrasting Win versus No Win trials. Our findings indicate that HSS show greater bilateral insular and prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain response on Win vs. No Win compared to LSS. Analysis of simple effects showed that while LSS showed comparable brain activity in these areas during Wins and No Wins, HSS showed significant differences in brain response to winning (activation) versus not winning (deactivation), with between-group comparison suggesting significant differences in brain response, largely to reward absence. Group differences in insular activation between reward receipt and absence may suggest weak autonomic arousal to negative outcomes in HSS compared with LSS. Additionally, since the PFC is important for goal-directed behavior and attention, the current results may reflect that HSS allocate fewer attentional resources to negative outcomes than LSS. This insensitivity to reward absence in HSS may lead to a greater likelihood of maladaptive choices when negative consequences are not considered, and may be an early neural marker of decreased loss sensitivity that has been seen in addiction. This neurobiological information may ultimately be helpful in establishing prevention strategies aimed at reducing youth risk-taking and suggests value in further examination of neural associations with personality characteristics during adolescence.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: I evaluate the contribution of a pioneering Human Factors special issue on human factors in industrial systems. BACKGROUND: Papers on the content of the journal's first 10 years showed that industrial human factors\/ergonomics (HF\/E) in 1969 was quite a rarity in the journal and the society. METHOD: The 12 papers in the special issue are reviewed briefly and show a wide range of topics, including traditional industrial engineering, physical HF\/E, and more mainstream applications of HF\/E in this domain similar to those in military and aerospace domains. The evaluation is through citations, later journal content, society technical group membership, and specific influences of Harris's own paper in the issue. RESULTS: The expected direct citation influence of this special issue was not found: Citation counts were in line with all papers in Human Factors. However, other journals have been founded in North America that serve industrial HF\/E and provide an outlet for more papers per year than Human Factors. In addition, the industrial domain is well represented in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. Finally, Harris's paper has been influential in the specific area of HF\/E in inspection.

{"abstract":"Global climate change and rising sea levels are impacting the sustainability and vitality of coastal communities, making identifying vulnerable areas particularly important to minimize the population and infrastructure at risk. In this paper, we expand the classic overlay method developed by Ian McHarg by incorporating sea level rise projections for the 2020s and 2050s into a GIS-based land use suitability analysis of New York City. This analysis considers elevation, slope, distance to coast, rock type, land cover, and sea level rise, which was modeled using a bathtub model. We use the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to produce weights for the criteria considered. Our results suggest that Eastern Staten Island and the southern shore of Brooklyn and Queens are especially unsuitable for future development without major adaptation measures. We also offer recommendations for improving this analysis through improved hydrological connectivity measures in modeling sea level rise, as well as better methods of accounting for policies influencing the manner of development in flood zones.

Strategic control remains for future study. BACKGROUND: Driving is a complex control task involving operational, tactical, and strategic control. Although operational control, such as lead-car following, has been studied, the influence of in-vehicle distractions on higher levels of control, including tactical and strategic, remains unclear. METHOD: Two secondary tasks were designed to independently represent visual-manual and cognitive-audio distractions, based on multiple resource theory. Drivers performed operational vehicle control maneuvers (lead-car following) or tactical control maneuvers (passing) along with the distraction tasks in a driving simulator. Response measures included driving performance and visual behavior. RESULTS: Results revealed drivers' ability to accommodate either visual or cognitive distractions in following tasks but not in passing. The simultaneous distraction condition led to the greatest decrement in performance.

{"abstract":"This study tested the predictive power of gaming versatility (i.e., the number of video game genres engaged in) on game addiction in male adolescents, controlling for time spent on gaming. Participants were 701 male adolescents attending high school (Mage=15.6 years). Analyses showed that pathological gaming was predicted not only by higher time spent on gaming, but also by participation in a greater number of video game genres. Specifically, the wider the array of video game genres played, the higher were the negative consequences caused by gaming. FINDINGS show that versatility can be considered as one of the behavioral risk factors related to gaming addiction, which may be characterized by a composite and diversified experience with video games. This study suggests that educational efforts designed to prevent gaming addiction among youth may also be focused on adolescents' engagement in different video games.

{"abstract":"The time it takes between consecutive foot contacts from the same leg is referred to as the stride-time interval. Several investigations have shown that the variations that are present in the stride time intervals are linked to walking balance. In this study, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was utilized to evaluate whether activation in the medial sensorimotor cortices reflects the amount of variations seen in the stride-time intervals. Thirteen healthy adults (Age=23.7\u00b11.4yrs.) walked forwards and backwards on a programmable treadmill. Each walking condition consisted of two sessions, with each being comprised of five alternating blocks of standing still or walking at 0.45m\/s. Activation in the medial sensorimotor cortices was measured using an fNIRS system, which consisted of a 4\u00d74 grid of infrared optode emitter\/detector pairs. The optodes were positioned on the participant's head using the International 10\/20 system with Cz located beneath the center of the front two rows of optodes. We evaluated the block-wise changes in the amount of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) in the channels that were located over the supplementary motor area, pre-central gyrus, post-central gyrus and superior parietal lobule. Throughout the experiment, a footswitch system was used to concurrently measure the amount of variation present in the stride-time intervals. Our results showed that oxyHb was greater in the supplementary motor area, pre-central gyrus, and superior parietal lobule when participants walked backwards rather than forwards, which suggests that backward walking presents more of a challenge to the nervous system as it controls the stepping pattern. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the amount of deoxyHb present in the supplementary motor area while walking backward. Consistent with previous investigations, we noted that the amount of variability present in the stride-time intervals was greater during backward walking compared to forward walking. In addition, the amount of variation in the stride-time intervals while walking forward was positively correlated with the maximum oxyHb response found in the pre-central gyrus and supplementary motor area, which has not been previously shown. This neurobehavioral relationship supports the notion that the subtle variations found in the stride-time intervals are partly associated with processing demands by the motor cortices for regulating the forward temporal kinematics.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: With the assumption that circadian rhythms influence human performance, the work of live line electricians was reorganized and evaluated. The hypothesis was that in highly physical and attention-demanding work, the organization of tasks, according to the ideal period of day and day of week, should diminish stress and consequent work risks. BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies reporting the work of electricians and even fewer approaching work organization. Moreover, these investigations often do not consider human physiological limitations and capabilities as well as task demands. METHOD: A new work system was proposed with consideration of (a) the circadian cycles and homeostatic processes; (b) the effect of heat, which is a zeitgeber (synchronizer) for the biological clocks; and (c) the degree of physical and mental demands of the different performed tasks, which was assessed on the basis of opinions of the electricians and physiological markers of stress that are controlled by circadian rhythms. The traditional and new systems were compared on the basis of two cognitive indices (the arrangement of matchsticks and the perception of a minute) and three physiological markers of mental-to-physical loads (heart frequency and the level of adrenaline and noradrenaline). RESULTS: Both physical and mental loads were reduced in the new system. CONCLUSION: Work organization should include consideration of human circadian rhythms, mainly when stressful and high-risk tasks are involved.

{"abstract":"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow a user to control a computer application by brain activity as measured, e.g., by electroencephalography (EEG). After about 30 years of BCI research, the success of control that is achieved by means of a BCI system still greatly varies between subjects. For about 20% of potential users the obtained accuracy does not reach the level criterion, meaning that BCI control is not accurate enough to control an application. The determination of factors that may serve to predict BCI performance, and the development of methods to quantify a predictor value from psychological and\/or physiological data serves two purposes: a better understanding of the 'BCI-illiteracy phenomenon', and avoidance of a costly and eventually frustrating training procedure for participants who might not obtain BCI control. Furthermore, such predictors may lead to approaches to antagonize BCI-illiteracy. Here, we propose a neurophysiological predictor of BCI performance which can be determined from a two minutes recording of a 'relax with eyes open' condition using two Laplacian EEG channels. A correlation of r = 0.53 between the proposed predictor and BCI feedback performance was obtained on a large data base with N = 80 BCI-naive participants in their first session with the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) system which operates on modulations of sensory motor rhythms (SMRs).

BACKGROUND: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. METHOD: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. RESULTS: In the windshear scenario, II pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. CONCLUSION: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety. Pre-exposure to a critical event triggering an auditory alarm can enhance alarm detection when a similar event is encountered subsequently. APPLICATION: Case-based learning is a solution to mitigate auditory alarm misperception.

{"abstract":"This study is a part of design of an audio system for in-house object detection system for visually impaired, low vision personnel by birth or by an accident or due to old age. The input of the system will be scene and output as audio. Alert facility is provided based on severity levels of the objects (snake, broke glass etc) and also during difficulties. The study proposed techniques to provide speedy detection of objects based on shapes and its scale. Features are extraction to have minimum spaces using dynamic scaling. From a scene, clusters of objects are formed based on the scale and shape. Searching is performed among the clusters initially based on the shape, scale, mean cluster value and index of object(s). The minimum operation to detect the possible shape of the object is performed. In case the object does not have a likely matching shape, scale etc, then the several operations required for an object detection will not perform; instead, it will declared as a new object. In such way, this study finds a speedy way of detecting objects. Language: en","authors":["Y.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of the present work was to examine the effects of mind state (mind-wandering vs. on-task) on driving performance in a high-fidelity driving simulator. BACKGROUND: Mind-wandering is thought to interfere with goal-directed thought. It is likely, then, that when driving, mind-wandering might lead to impairments in critical aspects of driving performance. In two experiments, we assess the extent to which mind-wandering interferes with responsiveness to sudden events, mean velocity, and headway distance. METHOD: Using a car-following procedure in a high-fidelity driving simulator, participants were probed at random times to indicate whether they were on-task at that moment or mind-wandering. The dependent measures were analyzed based on the participant's response to the probe. RESULTS: Compared to when on-task, when mind-wandering participants showed longer response times to sudden events, drove at a higher velocity, and maintained a shorter headway distance (close following). CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings indicate that mind-wandering affects a broad range of driving responses and may therefore lead to higher crash risk. APPLICATION: The results suggest that situations that are likely associated with mind-wandering (e.g., route familiarity) can impair driving performance.

{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a Pulse-Doppler radar system for in-home gait assessment of older adults. A methodology has been developed to extract gait parameters including walking speed and step time using Doppler radar. The gait parameters have been validated with a Vicon motion capture system in the lab with 13 participants and 158 test runs. The study revealed that for an optimal step recognition and walking speed estimation, a dual radar set up with one radar placed at foot level and the other at torso level is necessary. An excellent absolute agreement with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.97 was found for step time estimation with the foot level radar. For walking speed, although both radars show excellent consistency they all have a system offset compared to the ground truth due to walking direction with respect to the radar beam. The torso level radar has a better performance (9% offset on average) in the speed estimation compared to the foot level radar (13-18% offset). Quantitative analysis has been performed to compute the angles causing the systematic error. These lab results demonstrate the capability of the system to be used as a daily gait assessment tool in home environments, useful for fall risk assessment and other health care applications. The system is currently being tested in an unstructured home environment.

{"abstract":"Alcohol is a known exogenous modulator of negative affect (anxiety, tension) in both animals and humans. It has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala, an area critical to fear perception and responding. However, little is known about the acute effects of alcohol on amygdala reactivity to threatening information in humans. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well validated task to probe amygdala responses to social signals of threat in 12 healthy, social drinkers after a double-blind crossover administration of alcohol or placebo. We found that alcohol significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to threat signals. The current findings fit well with the notion that alcohol may attenuate threat-based responding and provide a potential brain-based mechanism for the link between alcohol and anxiety, and\/or social threat perception.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator study compared the effect of changes in workload on performance in manual and highly automated driving. Changes in driver state were also observed by examining variations in blink patterns. BACKGROUND: With the addition of a greater number of advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles, the driver's role is likely to alter in the future from an operator in manual driving to a supervisor of highly automated cars. Understanding the implications of such advancements on drivers and road safety is important. METHOD: A total of 50 participants were recruited for this study and drove the simulator in both manual and highly automated mode. As well as comparing the effect of adjustments in driving-related workload on performance, the effect of a secondary Twenty Questions Task was also investigated. RESULTS: In the absence of the secondary task, drivers' response to critical incidents was similar in manual and highly automated driving conditions. The worst performance was observed when drivers were required to regain control of driving in the automated mode while distracted by the secondary task. Blink frequency patterns were more consistent for manual than automated driving but were generally suppressed during conditions of high workload. CONCLUSION: Highly automated driving did not have a deleterious effect on driver performance, when attention was not diverted to the distracting secondary task.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated how human performance consequences of automated decision aids are affected by the degree of automation and the operator's functional state. BACKGROUND: As research has shown, decision aids may not only improve performance but also lead to new sorts of risks.Whereas knowledge exists about the impact of system characteristics (e.g., reliability) on human performance, little is known about how these performance consequences are moderated by the functional state of operators. METHOD: Participants performed a simulated supervisory process control task with one of two decision aids providing support for fault identification and management. One session took place during the day, and another one took place during the night after a prolonged waking phase of more than 20 hr. RESULTS: Results showed that decision aids can support humans effectively in maintaining high levels of performance, even in states of sleep loss, with more highly automated aids being more effective than less automated ones. Furthermore, participants suffering from sleep loss were found to be more careful in interaction with the aids, that is, less prone to effects of complacency and automation bias. However, cost effects arose that included a decline in secondary-task performance and an increased risk of return-to-manual performance decrements. CONCLUSION: Automation support can help protect performance after a period of extended wakefulness. In addition, operators suffering from sleep loss seem to compensate for their impaired functional state by reallocating resources and showing a more attentive behavior toward possible automation failures.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether continually updated information about a system's confidence in its ability to perform assigned tasks improves operators' trust calibration in, and use of, an automated decision support system (DSS). BACKGROUND: The introduction of decision aids often leads to performance breakdowns that are related to automation bias and trust miscalibration. This can be explained, in part, by the fact that operators are informed about overall system reliability only, which makes it impossible for them to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to follow the system's advice. METHOD: The application for this research was a neural net-based decision aid that assists pilots with detecting and handling in-flight icing encounters. A multifactorial experiment was carried out with two groups of 15 instructor pilots each flying a series of 28 approaches in a motion-base simulator. One group was informed about the system's overall reliability only, whereas the other group received updated system confidence information. RESULTS: Pilots in the updated group experienced significantly fewer icing-related stalls and were more likely to reverse their initial response to an icing condition when it did not produce desired results. Their estimate of the system's accuracy was more accurate than that of the fixed group.

{"abstract":"To determine if visual aging affects the ability to identify blurred text signs in daytime or nighttime viewing conditions, the photopic and mesopic legibility thresholds of young and old adult observers were compared at three levels of optically induced acuity (Experiment 1). For both age groups, legibility was reduced by nighttime luminance and degraded acuity. Surprisingly, older observers were better than younger ones in identifying defocused (optically blurred) text in both daytime and nighttime conditions. In Experiment 2, older observers were also superior to younger ones in identifying defocused standard and spatially matched novel text signs. These findings indicate that older observers' tolerance of optical blur is a generic ability, rather than one explained by familiarity with the low-pass optical profile of specific signs. Consistent with the notion that factors beyond acuity contribute more importantly to text legibility for older than for younger observers, acuity was a stronger predictor of legibility thresholds in the younger group. Actual or potential applications of this research include the need to consider functional acuity in visual screening protocols and the design of text displays, as well as the utilization of compensatory letter-recognition training for older observers or others with diminished acuity.

METHOD: Fundamental ideas and examples of human factors applications of each approach are presented and contrasted. RESULTS: Probabilistic risk analysis provides mathematical rigor in generalizing on past error events to identify system vulnerabilities, but prediction is problematical because (a) error definition is arbitrary, and thus it is difficult to infer valid probabilities of human error to input to quantitative models, and (b) future accident conditions are likely to be quite different from those of past accidents. The new resilience engineering paradigm, in contrast, is oriented toward organizational process and is concerned with anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for graceful recovery from future events.

Although >100 studies have been conducted to examine the impact of violent video games on aggression, no clear consensus has been reached, particularly in terms of their long-term impact on violent behavior and aggressive cognitions. This study employs a first-ever longitudinal laboratory-based experiment to examine longer-term effects of playing a violent video game. One hundred thirty-five participants were assigned either to the treatment condition where they played a violent video game in a controlled laboratory setting for a total of 12 hours or to the control group where they did not play a game. Participants in the treatment group played Grand Theft Auto IV over a period of 3 weeks and were compared with a control group on the posttest measures of trait aggression, attitudes toward violence, and empathy. The findings do not support the assertion that playing a violent video game for a period of 3 weeks increases aggression or reduces empathy, but they suggest a small increase in proviolence attitudes.

{"abstract":"Numerous recent studies have examined the impact of video gaming on various dependent variables, including the players' affective reactions, positive as well as detrimental cognitive effects, and real-world aggression. These target variables are typically analyzed as a function of game characteristics and player attributes-especially gender. However, findings on the uneven distribution of gaming experience between males and females, on the one hand, and the effect of gaming experience on several target variables, on the other hand, point at a possible confound when gaming experiments are analyzed with a standard analysis of variance. This study uses simulated data to exemplify analysis of regression residuals as a potentially beneficial data analysis strategy for such datasets. As the actual impact of gaming experience on each of the various dependent variables differs, the ultimate benefits of analysis of regression residuals entirely depend on the research question, but it offers a powerful statistical approach to video game research whenever gaming experience is a confounding factor.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether the stress reduction effects of phased training culminating in repeated exposure to a stressful scenario generalize to new scenarios. BACKGROUND: High-reliability occupations require personnel to operate in stressful situations involving complex environments, high degrees of uncertainty and time pressure, and severe consequences for mistakes. One method of training for such environments culminates in practice in high-fidelity, highly stressful simulations. For some domains, realism necessitates large-scale, difficult-to-modify physical simulations. This necessity often results in repeated exposure to one or very few scenarios. The literature gives reason to question whether the stress reduction effects of such exposure transfer to new scenarios. METHOD: Anxiety and cognitive difficulties were measured among firefighter trainees during three live-fire drills. For each trainee, two drills involved the same scenario, and the other involved a new scenario that was structurally similar to the repeated scenario. RESULTS: As predicted, anxiety and cognitive difficulties decreased across repetitions of the same scenario. However, the reduction did not generalize to a new scenario, and a nontrivial portion of the sample showed signs of negative transfer. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to the same stressful scenario as the final phase of training has limited practical value for stress reduction.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate use patterns among early adopters of adaptive cruise control (ACC). BACKGROUND: Extended use ofACC may influence a driver's behavior in the long-term, which can have unintended safety consequences. METHOD: The authors examined the use of a motion-based simulator by 24 participants (15 males and 9 females). Cluster analysis was performed on drivers' use of ACC and was based on their gap settings, speed settings, number of warnings issued, and ACC disengaged. The data were then examined on the basis of driving performance measures and drivers' subjective responses to trust in ACC, understanding of system operations, and driving styles. Driving performance measures included minimum time headway, adjusted minimum time to collision, and drivers' reaction time to critical events. RESULTS: Three groups of drivers were observed on the basis of risky behavior, moderately risky behavior, and conservative behavior. Drivers in the conservative group stayed farther behind the lead vehicle than did drivers in the other two groups. Risky drivers responded later to critical events and had more ACC warnings issued. CONCLUSION: Safety consequences with ACC may be more prevalent in some driver groups than others. The findings suggest that these safety implications are related to trust in automation, driving styles, understanding of system operations, and personalities. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include enhanced design for next-generation ACC systems and countermeasures to improve safe driving with ACC.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated five contextual variables that we hypothesized would influence driver acceptance of alerts to pedestrians issued by a night vision active safety system to inform the specification of the system's alerting strategies. BACKGROUND: Driver acceptance of automotive active safety systems is a key factor to promote their use and implies a need to assess factors influencing driver acceptance. METHOD: In a field operational test, 10 drivers drove instrumented vehicles equipped with a preproduction night vision system with pedestrian detection software. In a follow-up experiment, the 10 drivers and 25 additional volunteers without experience with the system watched 57 clips with pedestrian encounters gathered during the field operational test. They rated the acceptance of an alert to each pedestrian encounter. RESULTS: Levels of rating concordance were significant between drivers who experienced the encounters and participants who did not. Two contextual variables, pedestrian location and motion, were found to influence ratings. Alerts were more accepted when pedestrians were close to or moving toward the vehicle's path. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the utility of using subjective driver acceptance ratings to inform the design of active safety systems and to leverage expensive field operational test data within the confines of the laboratory. APPLICATION: The design of alerting strategies for active safety systems needs to heed the driver's contextual sensitivity to issued alerts.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The authors discuss empirical studies of human-automation interaction and their implications for automation design. BACKGROUND: Automation is prevalent in safety-critical systems and increasingly in everyday life. Many studies of human performance in automated systems have been conducted over the past 30 years. METHODS: Developments in three areas are examined: levels and stages of automation, reliance on and compliance with automation, and adaptive automation. RESULTS: Automation applied to information analysis or decision-making functions leads to differential system performance benefits and costs that must be considered in choosing appropriate levels and stages of automation. Human user dependence on automated alerts and advisories reflects two components of operator trust, reliance and compliance, which are in turn determined by the threshold designers use to balance automation misses and false alarms. Finally, adaptive automation can provide additional benefits in balancing workload and maintaining the user's situation awareness, although more research is required to identify when adaptation should be user controlled or system driven. CONCLUSIONS: The past three decades of empirical research on humans and automation has provided a strong science base that can be used to guide the design of automated systems.

{"abstract":"Consuming an unhealthy level of alcohol is a significant problem for some young women. Potential determinants of excess consumption include perceptions of usual consumption among peers-perceptions of what is \"normal.\" The present study examined whether perceptions of social normative endorsement of drinking, operationalized by measures of perceived alcohol consumption of close friends (proximal norms), the consumption of the \"average student\" (distal norms), and the extent of alcohol-related content posted by peers on Facebook were related to alcohol-related attitudes and self-reported consumption. Female university students (n=129; Mage=21.48 years, SD=3.00) completed an online questionnaire assessing Facebook use, perceived alcohol-related norms, and self-reported alcohol attitudes and consumption. Perceptions of the consumption of the average female student were a negative predictor of attitudes. Positive alcohol attitudes, extent of own alcohol-related photographic posts on Facebook, average female student alcohol consumption, and report of male close friend consumption predicted self-report of own alcohol consumption. Interestingly, female close friend norms failed to predict consumption, whereas male close friend norms predicted consumption but not attitudes, suggesting the possibility of separate cognitive pathways for alcohol-related attitudes and behavior. This study builds on existing research by casting new light on predictors of alcohol-related attitudes, as well as describing the potential role of social networking sites such as Facebook in the formation of social norms and the modulation of drinking behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the way in which the type and preexisting strength of association between an auditory icon and a warning event affects the ease with which the icon\/event pairing can be learned and retained. BACKGROUND: To be effective, an auditory warning must be audible, identifiable, interpretable, and heeded. Warnings consisting of familiar environmental sounds, or auditory icons, have potential to facilitate identification and interpretation. The ease with which pairings between auditory icons and warning events can be learned and retained is likely to depend on the type and strength of the preexisting icon\/event association. METHOD: Sixty-three participants each learned eight auditory-icon\/denotative-referent pairings and attempted to recall them 4 weeks later. Three icon\/denotative-referent association types (direct, related, and unrelated) were employed. Participants rated the strength of the association for each pairing on a 7-point scale. RESULTS: The number of errors made while learning pairings was greater for unrelated than for either related or direct associations, whereas the number of errors made while attempting to recall pairings 4 weeks later was greater for unrelated than for related associations and for related than for direct associations. Irrespective of association type, both learning and retention performance remained at very high levels, provided the strength of the association was rated greater than 5. CONCLUSION: This suggests that strong preexisting associations are used to facilitate learning and retention of icon\/denotative-referent pairings. APPLICATION: The practical implication of this study is that auditory icons having either direct or strong, indirect associations with warning events should be preferred.

{"abstract":"Theoretical models and experimental evidence suggest that cortico-striatal-cerebellar networks play a crucial role in mediating motor sequence learning. However, how these different regions interact in order to mediate learning is less clear. In the present fMRI study, we used dynamic causal modeling to investigate effective connectivity within the cortico-striatal-cerebellar network while subjects performed a serial reaction time task. Using Bayesian model selection and family wise inference, we show that the cortico-cerebellar loop had higher model evidence than the cortico-striatal loop during motor learning. We observed significant negative modulatory effects on the connections from M1 to cerebellum bilaterally during learning. The results suggest that M1 causes the observed decrease in activity in the cerebellum as learning progresses. The current study stresses the significant role that the cerebellum plays in motor learning as previously suggested by fMRI studies in healthy subjects as well as behavioral studies in patients with cerebellar dysfunction. These results provide important insight into the neural mechanisms underlying motor learning. Language: en","authors":["Elinor Tzvi","Thomas F. M\u00fcnte","Ulrike M.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effects of a PC-based training program on risk perception in a driving simulator. BACKGROUND: Novice drivers have a fatality rate some eight times higher than that of the most experienced group of drivers, primarily because of the novice driver's inability to predict ahead of time the risks that will appear in the roadway. Current driver education programs, at least those in the United States, do not emphasize the teaching of risk awareness skills to novice drivers. METHOD: A PC-based risk awareness and perception training program was developed and evaluated. The training involved using plan (top-down) views of 10 risky scenarios that helped novice drivers identify where potential risks were located and what information should be attended. Both the 24 trained novice drivers and 24 untrained novice drivers were evaluated on an advanced driving simulator. The eye movements of both groups of drivers were measured. The evaluation on the driving simulator included both scenarios used in the training and others not used in training. RESULTS: The set of trained novice drivers were almost twice as likely as untrained drivers to fixate appropriately either on the regions where potential risks might appear or on signs that warned of potentially risky situations ahead, both for the scenarios they had encountered in training and for novel scenarios. APPLICATION: The PC training program developed, which is portable and can be widely used, has great promise in improving risk perception for novice drivers on the road.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to enable the head-up monitoring of two interrelated aircraft navigation instruments by developing a 3-D auditory display that encodes this navigation information within two spatially discrete sonifications. BACKGROUND: Head-up monitoring of aircraft navigation information utilizing 3-D audio displays, particularly involving concurrently presented sonifications, requires additional research. METHOD: A flight simulator's head-down waypoint bearing and course deviation instrument readouts were conveyed to participants via a 3-D auditory display. Both readouts were separately represented by a colocated pair of continuous sounds, one fixed and the other varying in pitch, which together encoded the instrument value's deviation from the norm. Each sound pair's position in the listening space indicated the left\/right parameter of its instrument's readout. Participants' accuracy in navigating a predetermined flight plan was evaluated while performing a head-up task involving the detection of visual flares in the out-of-cockpit scene. RESULTS: The auditory display significantly improved aircraft heading and course deviation accuracy, head-up time, and flare detections. Head tracking did not improve performance by providing participants with the ability to orient potentially conflicting sounds, suggesting that the use of integrated localizing cues was successful. CONCLUSION: A supplementary 3-D auditory display enabled effective head-up monitoring of interrelated navigation information normally attended to through a head-down display. APPLICATION: Pilots operating aircraft, such as helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, may benefit from a supplementary auditory display because they navigate in two dimensions while performing head-up, out-of-aircraft, visual tasks.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Traditional T2 weighted MR imaging results are non-specific for the extent of underlying white matter structural abnormalities present in late life depression (LLD). Diffusion tensor imaging provides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent and nature of structural injury, but has been limited by examining only a subset of regions of interest (ROI) and by confounds common to the study of an elderly population, including comorbid vascular pathology. Furthermore, comprehensive correlation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements, including axial and radial diffusivity measurements, has not been demonstrated in the late life depression population. METHODS: 51 depressed and 16 non-depressed, age- and cerebrovascular risk factor-matched elderly subjects underwent traditional anatomic T1 and T2 weight imaging, as well as DTI. The DTI data were skeletonized using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), and both regional and global analyses were performed. RESULTS: Widespread structural abnormalities within white matter were detected in the LLD group, accounting for age, gender and education and matched for cerebrovascular risk factors and global T2 white matter hyperintensities (T2WMH). Regional differences were most prominent in uncinate and cingulate white matter and were generally characterized by an increase in radial diffusivity. Age-related changes particularly in the cingulate bundle were more advanced in individuals with LLD relative to controls. Regression analysis demonstrated significant correlations of regional fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity with five different neuropsychological factor scores. TBSS analysis demonstrated a greater extent of white matter abnormalities in LLD not responsive to treatment, as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: White matter integrity is compromised in late life depression, largely manifested by increased radial diffusivity in specific regions, suggesting underlying myelin injury. A possible mechanism for underlying myelin injury is chronic white matter ischemia related to intrinsic cerebrovascular disease. In some regions such as the cingulate bundle, the white matter injury related to late life depression appears to be independent of and compounded by age-related changes. The correlations with neuropsychological testing indicate the essential effects of white matter injury on functional status. Lastly, response to treatment may depend on the extent of white matter injury, suggesting a need for intact functional networks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether teaming up mitigates individual vulnerability to task interruptions in complex dynamic situations. BACKGROUND: Omnipresent in everyday multitasking environments, task interruptions are usually detrimental to individual performance. This is particularly crucial in dynamic command and control (C2) safety-critical contexts because of the additional challenge imposed by the continually evolving situation during the interruption. METHOD: We employed a firefighting microworld to simulate C2 in the context of supervisory control to examine the relative impact of interruptions on participants working in a functional dyad versus operators working alone. RESULTS: Although task interruption was detrimental to participants' efficacy of monitoring resources, the negative impact of interruption was reduced for those working in teams. Teaming up translated into faster resumption time, but only if both teammates were interrupted simultaneously. Interrupting only one team member was associated with increased postinterruption communications and slower resumption time. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that in complex dynamic situations working in a small team confers more resistance to task interruption than working alone by virtue of the reduced individual workload typical of teamwork. The benefit of collaborative work seems nevertheless mediated by the coordination and communication overhead associated with teamwork. APPLICATION: The present findings have practical implications for operators dealing with unexpected events such as task interruptions in C2 environments.

{"abstract":"In this work, we argue that system accident literacy and safety competence should be an essential part of the intellectual toolkit of all engineering students. We discuss why such competence should be taught and nurtured in engineering students, and provide one example for how this can be done. We first define the class of adverse events of interest as system accidents, distinct from occupational accidents, through their (1) temporal depth of causality and (2) diversity of agency or groups and individuals who influence or contribute to the accident occurrence\/prevention. We then address the question of why the interest in this class of events and their prevention, and we expand on the importance of system safety literacy and the contributions that engineering students can make in the long-term towards accident prevention. Finally, we offer one model for an introductory course on accident causation and system safety, discuss the course logistics, material and delivery, and our experience teaching this subject. The course starts with the anatomy of accidents and is grounded in various case studies; these help illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of the subject, and provide the students with the important concepts to describe the phenomenology of accidents (e.g., initiating events, accident precursor or lead indicator, and accident pathogen). More importantly, the case studies invite a deep reflection on the underlying failure mechanisms, their generalizability, and the various safety levers for accident prevention. The course then proceeds to an exposition of defense-in-depth, safety barriers and principles, essential elements for an education in accident prevention, and it concludes with a presentation of basic concepts and tools for uncertainty and risk analysis. Educators will recognize the difficulties in designing a new course on such a broad subject. It is hoped that this work will invite comments and contributions from the readers, and that the journal will support the publication of exchanges on this subject. Language: en","authors":["Joseph H.

{"abstract":"The present research investigated the possibility of using an in-vehicle voice agent to promote eco-driving. Considering that both types of benefit appeals--egoistic (emphasizing benefits to the self) and altruistic (emphasizing benefits to others)--could be employed to promote eco-driving behavior, we explored the effects of benefit appeals delivered by an in-vehicle voice agent on driving performance. In particular, we tested whether and how the valence (positive vs. negative) of drivers' affective states moderates the effects, drawing on the functionalist affect-cognition framework, which has theorized that positive affect leads people to focus more on self-interest, whereas negative affect leads people to become more sensitive to social norms. An experiment was conducted in which participants, after undergoing affect (happy vs. sad) elicitation, received messages (egoistic vs. altruistic) promoting eco-driving from an in-vehicle voice agent while performing a simulated driving task. RESULTS were partially consistent with the functionalist affect-cognition framework. Happy participants performed better on eco-driving when they were exposed to egoistic appeals than to altruistic appeals. On the other hand, the driving performance data from sad participants did not yield a significant difference between the egoistic condition and the altruistic condition. Participants' driving performance data further revealed that the joint effects of benefit appeals and affective states on safe driving performance mirrored the joint effects on eco-driving performance, confirming a close relationship between the two driving behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of in-vehicle voice agents and benefit appeals in promoting eco-driving and safe driving are discussed.

{"abstract":"In urban areas, the occurrence of disasters can cause extensive damage to human society. For this reason, evacuation, regarded as a critical course of action to relocate people and property, helps to alleviate loss of life and property to a great extent. Risk associated with evacuation is an abstract concept that cannot be easily conceptualized. This paper develops a model for assessing and visualizing the risks associated with the evacuation process in response to potential catastrophes. Understanding of evacuation risk, the potential for losing transport connections and the difficulty of transferring rescue resources, was previously limited by considering pre-disaster factors only. This study mitigates such limitation by extending previous research to include the contingent post-disaster factors that have received scant attention to date. Two contingent post-disaster factors: the spatial impact of the disaster and the potential for traffic congestion caused by the evacuee routing behaviors, are discussed in detail and integrated into the model along with other pre-disaster factors. A case study on the transportation network of Beijing, China is used to demonstrate the value of the model. This paper asserts that the notion of evacuation risk is not a static evaluation of such factors as road vulnerability; rather it involves a dynamic process where contingent factors associated with disastrous events play a role. This model can help city emergency planners to identify urban infrastructures that may hinder an efficient evacuation process because of their deficient configuration.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether communicating automation uncertainty improves the driver-automation interaction. BACKGROUND: A false system understanding of infallibility may provoke automation misuse and can lead to severe consequences in case of automation failure. The presentation of automation uncertainty may prevent this false system understanding and, as was shown by previous studies, may have numerous benefits. Few studies, however, have clearly shown the potential of communicating uncertainty information in driving. The current study fills this gap. METHOD: We conducted a driving simulator experiment, varying the presented uncertainty information between participants (no uncertainty information vs. uncertainty information) and the automation reliability (high vs.low) within participants. Participants interacted with a highly automated driving system while engaging in secondary tasks and were required to cooperate with the automation to drive safely. RESULTS: Quantile regressions and multilevel modeling showed that the presentation of uncertainty information increases the time to collision in the case of automation failure. Furthermore, the data indicated improved situation awareness and better knowledge of fallibility for the experimental group. Consequently, the automation with the uncertainty symbol received higher trust ratings and increased acceptance. CONCLUSION: The presentation of automation uncertaintythrough a symbol improves overall driver-automation cooperation. APPLICATION: Most automated systems in driving could benefit from displaying reliability information. This display might improve the acceptance of fallible systems and further enhances driver-automation cooperation.

This involves the ability to search for relevant information, assess opportunities and priorities, and maintain performance under stress. The PC-based WOMBAT test has been designed to measure individual aptitude to cope with such demands. In the first experiment performance on the WOMBAT test was compared with performance on a battery of tests of specific underlying abilities. In the second experiment the performance of elite soaring pilots was compared with that of matched pilot and control groups.

{"abstract":"This study was conducted to explore the lifestyles of online game players who have adopted the virtual world as part of their life. An online survey was conducted on players of an Internet-based game, Lineage. Lineage is the largest online game where people assume new identities and play various roles in a virtual environment, accommodating over 6 million users worldwide. A total of 4,786 game players participated in this survey, and their lifestyles were compared with their values and attitudes in the virtual world. Upon classification of their real-world lifestyles, their tendencies and desires were compared to lifestyles in the virtual world. This study showed that game players have developed their own distinctive lifestyles, and their lifestyles were a strong criterion for explaining behavior patterns and desires in the virtual world. Lifestyles were classified into three general categories: (1) single-oriented player, (2) community-oriented player, and (3) off-Real world player. Each group displayed distinct differences in their values and game activities, as well as in their anti-social behavior tendencies. The differences reflected not only their personality but also their socio-economic status within the virtual world, which is constructed through game activities. This study serves as a model to understand how players from different real-life backgrounds will behave in various game features and how they adopt the virtual world for their new social identities.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Analyses of novel linguistic and grammatical features, extracted from transcribed speech of people working in a collaborative environment, were performed for cognitive load measurement BACKGROUND: Prior studies have attempted to assess users' cognitive load with several measures, but most of them are intrusive and disrupt normal task flow. An effective measurement of people's cognitive load can help improve their performance by deploying appropriate output and support strategies accordingly. METHODS: The authors studied 33 members of bushfire management teams working collaboratively in computerized incident control rooms and involved in complex bushfire management tasks. The participants' communication was analyzed for some novel linguistic features as potential indices of cognitive load, which included sentence length, use of agreement and disagreement phrases, and use of personal pronouns, including both singular and plural pronoun types. RESULTS: Results showed users' different linguistic and grammatical patterns with various cognitive load levels. Specifically, with high load, people spoke more and used longer sentences, used more words that indicated disagreement with other team members, and exhibited increased use of plural personal pronouns and decreased use of singular pronouns. CONCLUSION: The article provides encouraging evidence for the use of linguistic and grammatical analysis for measuring users' cognitive load and proposes some novel features as cognitive load indices. APPLICATION: The proposed approach may be applied to many data-intense and safety-critical task scenarios, such as emergency management departments, for example, bushfire or traffic incident management centers; air traffic control rooms; and call centers, where speech is used as part of everyday tasks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We describe major discoveries and developments in vigilance research. BACKGROUND: Vigilance tasks have typically been viewed as undemanding assignments requiring little mental effort. The vigilance decrement function has also been considered to result from a decline in arousal brought about by understimulation. METHODS: Recent research in vigilance is reviewed in four areas: studies of task type, perceived mental workload during vigilance, neural measures of resource demand in vigilance, and studies of task-induced stress. RESULTS: Experiments comparing successive and simultaneous vigilance tasks support an attentional resource theory of vigilance. Subjective reports also show that the workload of vigilance is high and sensitive to factors that increase processing demands. Neuroimaging studies using transcranial Doppler sonography provide strong, independent evidence for resource changes linked to performance decrement in vigilance tasks. Finally, physiological and subjective reports confirm that vigilance tasks reduce task engagement and increase distress and that these changes rise with increased task difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: Converging evidence using behavioral, neural, and subjective measures shows that vigilance requires hard mental work and is stressful.

BACKGROUND: During the past three decades, much of the empirical warnings research has been published in human factors and ergonomics (HF\/E) literature.

{"abstract":"Jill Palzkill Woelfer discusses vulnerability, susceptibility, and more than six years of research with homeless young people. In the US government and international organization documents, vulnerability has been assigned to groups as diverse as pregnant women, children, prisoners, students, employees, members of the armed forces or police, nursing home residents, people receiving welfare benefits or social assistance, other poor people, the unemployed, patients, some ethnic and racial minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, politically powerless individuals, and people unfamiliar with modern medical concepts. Identifying all these groups as vulnerable may help to frame research that is less likely to cause harm to participants. Once homeless, a young person may be further harmed by persistent negative experiences with institutions such as police and the court system, by violence, or by the situational exacerbation of mental illness or substance abuse, and so on. Harm may also arise through societal factors such as stigmatization and stereotyping.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A model of conflict judgments in air traffic control (ATC) is proposed. BACKGROUND: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt(o) is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt(h) is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt(v) is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1000 feet. METHODS: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. RESULTS: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N=161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N=88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. CONCLUSION: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether spatialized nonspeech beacons could guide navigation and how sound timbre, waypoint capture radius, and practice affect performance. BACKGROUND: Auditory displays may assist mobility and wayfinding for those with temporary or permanent visual impairment, but they remain understudied. Previous systems have used speech-based interfaces. METHOD: Participants (108 undergraduates) navigated three maps, guided by one of three beacons (pink noise, sonar ping, or 1000-Hz pure tone) spatialized by a virtual reality engine. Dependent measures were efficiency of time and path length. RESULTS: Overall navigation was very successful, with significant effects of practice and capture radius, and interactions with beacon sound. Overshooting and subsequent hunting for waypoints was exacerbated for small radius conditions. A human-scale capture radius (1.5 m) and sonar-like beacon yielded the optimal combination for safety and efficiency. CONCLUSION: The selection of beacon sound and capture radius depend on the specific application, including whether speed of travel or adherence to path are of primary concern. Extended use affects sound preferences and quickly leads to improvements in both speed and accuracy.

{"abstract":"In 2 experiments, a 12-min computerized vigilance task was demonstrated to reproduce the vigilance decrement, high workload (NASA-TLX), and stressful character (Dundee Stress State Questionnaire) of vigilance tasks lasting 30 min or more. In Experiment 1, the abbreviated task was also shown to duplicate the signal salience effect, a major finding associated with long-duration vigilance tasks. Moreover, Experiment 2 showed that performance on the abbreviated task can be enhanced by caffeine - a drug that benefits long-duration tasks. This enhancement effect was limited to performance, however, suggesting that caffeine influences factors that control signal detection but not those that control task-induced stress. The results parallel those obtained with long-duration tasks and support a resource-depletion model of the vigilance decrement.

{"abstract":"Recent animal studies have suggested that cortical areas may play a greater role in the modulation of abnormal oscillatory activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) than previously recognized. We investigated task and medication-dependent, EEG-based directional cortical connectivity in the \u03b8 (4-7 Hz), \u03b1 (8-12 Hz), \u03b2 (13-30 Hz) and low \u03b3 (31-50 Hz) frequency bands in 10 PD subjects and 10 age-matched controls. All subjects performed a visually guided task previously shown to modulate abnormal oscillatory activity in PD subjects. We examined the connectivity in the simultaneously-recorded EEG between 5 electrode regions of interest (Fronto-Central, Left and Right Sensorimotor, Central and Occipital) using a sparse, multivariate, autoregressive-based partial directed coherence method. For comparison, we utilized traditional Fourier analysis to evaluate task-dependent frequency spectra modulation in these same regions. While the spectral analysis revealed some overall differences between PD and control subjects, it demonstrated relatively modest changes between regions. In contrast, the partial directed coherence-based analysis revealed multifaceted, regionally and directionally-dependent alterations of connectivity in PD subjects during both movement preparation and execution. Connectivity was particularly altered posteriorly, suggesting abnormalities in visual and visuo-motor processing in PD. Moreover, connectivity measures in the \u03b1, \u03b2 and low \u03b3 frequency ranges correlated with motor Unified Parkinson\u201fs Disease Rating Scores in PD subjects withdrawn from medication. Levodopa administration only partially restored connectivity, and in some cases resulted in further exacerbation of abnormalities. Our results support the notion that PD is associated with significant alterations in connectivity between brain regions, and that these changes can be non-invasively detected in the EEG using partial directed coherence methods. Thus, the role of EEG to monitor PD may need to be further expanded. Language: en","authors":["G. Tropini","Joyce Chiang","Z. Jane Wang","Edna Ty","Martin J.

{"abstract":"We examined whether older and younger adults share a schema for taking medication and whether instructions are better recalled when they are organized to match this schema. Experiment 1 examined age difference in schema organization. Participants sorted medication items (e.g., purpose, dose, possible side effects) according to similarity and then ordered the items to create a preferred instruction set. Cluster analysis of the sort and order data showed that younger and older adults share a schema for taking medication. Secondary regression analyses found that verbal ability (i.e., vocabulary scores) predicted individual differences in schema organization. In Experiment 2 participants recalled instructions that were either compatible with this schema in terms of grouping and order of items or were presented in nonpreferred orders. Younger participants remembered more information than did older participants, but both age groups better remembered and preferred the more schema-compatible instructions. Secondary analyses showed that recall was also positively related to verbal ability. Along with our earlier research, this study suggests that older and younger adults possess a schema for taking medication and that instructions that are compatible with this schema provide an environmental support that improves memory for medication information.

{"abstract":"The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) of locusts is a visual interneuron that responds with an increasing spike frequency to an object approaching on a direct collision course. Recent studies involving the use of LGMD models to detect car collisions showed that it could detect collisions, but the neuron produced collision alerts to non-colliding, translating, stimuli in many cases. This study presents a modified model to address these problems. It shows how the neurons pre-synaptic to the LGMD show a remarkable ability to filter images, and only colliding and translating stimuli produce excitation in the neuron. It then integrates the LGMD network with models based on the elementary movement detector (EMD) neurons from the fly visual system, which are used to analyse directional excitation patterns in the biologically filtered images. Combining the information from the LGMD neuron and four directionally sensitive neurons produces a robust collision detection system for a wide range of automotive test situations.

{"abstract":"Problems related to fire hazard and fire management have become in recent decades one of the most relevant issues in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), that is the area where human infrastructures meet or intermingle with natural vegetation. In this paper we develop a robust geospatial method for defining and mapping the WUI in the Alpine environment, where most interactions between infrastructures and wildland vegetation concern the fire ignition through human activities, whereas no significant threats exist for infrastructures due to contact with burning vegetation. We used the three Alpine Swiss cantons of Ticino, Valais and Grisons as the study area. The features representing anthropogenic infrastructures (urban or infrastructural components of the WUI) as well as forest cover related features (wildland component of the WUI) were selected from the Swiss Topographic Landscape Model (TLM3D). Georeferenced forest fire occurrences derived from the WSL Swissfire database were used to define suitable WUI interface distances. The Random Forest algorithm was applied to estimate the importance of predictor variables to fire ignition occurrence. This revealed that buildings and drivable roads are the most relevant anthropogenic components with respect to fire ignition. We consequently defined the combination of drivable roads and easily accessible (i.e. 100 m from the next drivable road) buildings as the WUI-relevant infrastructural component. For the definition of the interface (buffer) distance between WUI infrastructural and wildland components, we computed the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the percentage of ignition points (observed and simulated) arising at increasing distances from the selected infrastructures. The ECDF facilitates the calculation of both the distance at which a given percentage of ignition points occurred and, in turn, the amount of forest area covered at a given distance. Finally, we developed a GIS ModelBuilder routine to map the WUI for the selected buffer distance. The approach was found to be reproducible, robust (based on statistical analyses for evaluating parameters) and flexible (buffer distances depending on the targeted final area covered) so that fire managers may use it to detect WUI according to their specific priorities.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated speech, environmental sounds (naturally occurring sounds with arbitrary meanings), auditory icons (natural or synthetic sounds with specific meanings), and abstract synthetic warnings as candidates for within-vehicle interfaces. BACKGROUND: Auditory displays and warnings must satisfy certain criteria, such as being appropriately urgent and commanding appropriately fast response times. However, a semiotic analysis suggests that displays, as signals interpreted by users, should also be mapped successfully onto their referents. METHOD: Response times and accuracy were recorded in a computer task of identifying learned mappings of candidate displays to a range of referent driving events (such as\"headway closing\"); perceived urgency and pleasantness were assessed separately. RESULTS: Speech and auditory icons produced near-ceiling performance in response times and identification accuracy. Abstract sounds produced notably slower response times and less accuracy. Environmental sounds showed an intermediate pattern of performance for accuracy, but the response times were similar to those of the abstract sounds. Speech utterances were similarly and consistently rated as pleasant but also of intermediate perceived urgency. The three other sound types showed a consistent mapping of their perceived urgency to the situational urgency of their referents; for these sounds, perceived urgency and pleasantness were negatively correlated. CONCLUSION: The results point to the importance of considering the role of signal-referent relationships in designing auditory displays. APPLICATION: The results have applicability for auditory displays in the vehicle interface, whereas the theoretical framework is of value in auditory display design in a broader context.

{"abstract":"Decrements in the proportion of signals detected over time on task and large individual differences in performance are typical findings in studies of vigilance. This study investigates the effects of signal probability on individual differences in vigilance performance. Participants monitored stimulus events on computer displays over 2-h periods at three signal probability levels (.01, .04, & .12). Results were analyzed between groups, within groups, and within subjects. Detection decrements were found to be inversely related to signal probability levels across groups. High signal probabilities generated consistent within-group and within-subject performance, whereas low probabilities generated both lower performance and larger within-subject variance. This relationship between signal probability and within-group and within-subject variance has not been previously demonstrated. Future investigations should focus on the sources of both between-subjects and within-subject variation in vigilance performance in order to identify optimal interventions. Actual or potential applications include designing work to minimize vigilance decrement and maximize human performance under conditions that require sustained attention.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: An experiment investigated the efficacy of auditory icons as warning signals in an aviation context. BACKGROUND: Iconic signals, such as a cough to signal dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, convey information about the nature of an incident and alert the operator that there is a problem, whereas signals that are arbitrarily associated with a critical incident provide relatively less information. Warning recognition speed and accuracy are likely to be influenced by modality of presentation (visual, auditory, auditory + visual) and task demand (low, high). METHODS: The 172 participants completed a computer-based training session and test task that involved responding to abstract or iconic auditory (1 s), visual, or auditory + visual warnings associated with seven critical incidents while performing low- and high-demand concurrent tasks. RESULTS: Significantly fewer training trials were required to learn iconic warnings than abstract warnings. An advantage for iconic warnings persisted into the test phase, evident most consistently as greater warning recognition accuracy. The effect was observed in both high- and low-demand conditions. Auditory abstract warnings, in particular, elicited slow reaction times and poor accuracy. CONCLUSION: Associations between a small number of meaningful environmental sounds and critical incidents can be learned with ease relative to more abstract associations, although training is required and response times are relatively slow. APPLICATION: Sets of distinctive auditory iconic warnings can be designed to alert and inform pilots about non-time-pressured events. Potential applications of language-neutral icons as informative warnings include civil, commercial, and defense aircraft. Language: en","authors":["Nathan Perry","Catherine J. Stevens","Mark W.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether anesthesia residents (physicians in training) performed clinical duties in the operating room differently during the day versus at night. BACKGROUND: Fatigue from sleep deprivation and working through the night is common for physicians, particularly during residency training. METHODS: Using a repeated-measures design, we studied 13 pairs of day-night matched anesthesia cases. Dependent measures included task times, workload ratings, response to an alarm light latency task, and mood. RESULTS: Residents spent significantly less time on manual tasks and more time on monitoring tasks during the maintenance phase at night than during the day. Residents reported more negative mood at night than during the day, both pre- and postoperation. However, time of day had no effect on the mood change between pre- and postoperation. Workload ratings and the response time to an alarm light latency task were not significantly different between night and day cases. CONCLUSIONS: Because night shift residents had been awake and working for more than 16 hr, the observed differences in task performance and mood may be attributed to fatigue. The changes in task distribution during night shift work may represent compensatory strategies to maintain patient care quality while keeping perceived workload at a manageable level. APPLICATIONS: Fatigue effects during night shifts should be considered when designing work-rest schedules for clinicians. This matched-case control scheme can also be applied to study other phenomena associated with patient safety in the actual clinical environment. Language: en","authors":["Caroline G. L.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether elderly individuals underestimate the time that it will take them to cross a street by comparing estimated with actual road-crossing time. BACKGROUND: In many developed countries, elderly people are overrepresented among pedestrian fatalities from motor vehicle accidents. There is surely more than one contributing factor to this phenomenon, and many have been offered. We propose that one additional factor may be that although older people are consciously aware that they no longer walk at the same pace as they once did, they do not take this fact into consideration when planning a street crossing. METHOD: We compared the ability of young and old pedestrians to estimate the time that it will take them to cross a street, using both prospective and retrospective time estimation. RESULTS: A significant interaction was found between age group and crossing time. Among elderly participants, actual crossing times were significantly longer than both their precrossing estimation and their postcrossing estimation, which did not significantly differ from each other. In contrast, the undergraduate group's crossing times did not display a significant difference across measurements. CONCLUSION: This study implies that even if older pedestrians correctly evaluate the road situation, they may nonetheless endanger themselves by underestimating the time that it will take them to cross the street.We suggest that minimizing this effect could be accomplished by educating seniors to the fact that they are not as fast as they once were and that this fact needs to be factored in to street-crossing decisions.

A survey conducted in Malaysia with 469 SNS users aged 13-14 revealed that control-based parental mediation can cause boomerang effects, making young adolescents more inclined to taking risks in SNSs. While discussion-based parental mediation was found to be negatively related to young adolescents' befriending strangers in SNSs, it did not reduce privacy risks. FINDINGS also suggested that peer influence could result in undesirable outcomes. In particular, the more young adolescents talked about Internet-related issues with peers, the more likely they were to disclose personally identifiable information on SNSs.

In our approach, we provide analysts with a suite of natural scale templates and methods that enable them to focus and drill down to appropriate geospatial and temporal resolution levels. Our forecasting technique is based on the Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) method, which we apply in a spatiotemporal visual analytics context to provide analysts with predicted levels of future activity.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Shooter accuracy and stability were monitored while firing two bullpup and two conventional configuration rifles of the same caliber in order to determine if one style of weapon results in superior performance. BACKGROUND: Considerable debate exists among police and military professionals regarding the differences between conventional configuration weapons, where the magazine and action are located ahead of the trigger, and bullpup configuration, where they are located behind the trigger (closer to the user). To date, no published research has attempted to evaluate this question from a physical ergonomics standpoint, and the knowledge that one style might improve stability or result in superior performance is of interest to countless military, law enforcement, and industry experts. METHOD: A live-fire evaluation of both weapon styles was performed using a total of 48 participants. Shooting accuracy and fluctuations in biomechanical stability (center of pressure) were monitored while subjects used the weapons to perform standard drills. RESULTS: The bullpup weapon designs were found to provide a significant advantage in accuracy and shooter stability, while subjects showed considerable preference toward the conventional weapons. CONCLUSION: Although many mechanical and maintenance issues must be considered before committing to a bullpup or conventional weapon system, it is clear in terms of basic human stability that the bullpup is the more advantageous configuration. APPLICATION: Results can be used by competitive shooter, military, law enforcement, and industry experts while outfitting personnel with a weapon system that leads to superior performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of head movement frequency and predictive compensation on (a) latency produced in a monocular see-through helmet-mounted display (HMD) test bed and (b) simulator sickness experienced by users wearing the HMD. BACKGROUND: There is conflicting research regarding latency as a significant factor in the onset of simulator sickness. Predictive compensation has been shown to mitigate the magnitude of latency, but little is known about the extent of its effect on simulator sickness. METHOD: A video camera recorded HMD and simulator imagery to accurately measure apparent latency produced at three head movement frequencies. Predictive compensation strategies were manipulated to measure the difference in apparent latency produced by the test bed in various conditions. Similar methodology was employed with human participants to measure simulator sickness experienced by users of this test bed. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, apparent latency increased significantly as head movement frequency increased. Predictive compensation strategies significantly reduced apparent latency present in the test bed. In Experiment 2, predictive compensation significantly reduced the magnitude of simulator sickness. CONCLUSION: Predictive compensation can be effectively implemented to reduce apparent latency, resulting in a lower magnitude of simulator sickness. APPLICATION: Potential applications include HMD use in which head position is tracked and visual imagery is linked to head or body movement, such as in virtual and augmented reality systems, and is thus critical to functionality and performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The effect of viewpoint on the navigation of complex terrain and on spatial awareness was examined with the use of a simulated remotely operated vehicle. BACKGROUND: The ability to build terrain models in real time may soon allow remote vehicular control from any viewpoint. A virtual tether couples the viewpoint to the vehicle's position and orientation, but shows more of the terrain than a fully immersive egocentric display. In this sense, it provides visual momentum by providing a view that incorporates egocentric and exocentric qualities. METHOD: For this study, 12 participants navigated a simulated vehicle across complex virtual terrain using five different display viewpoints: egocentric, dynamic tether, rigid tether, 3-D exocentric, and 2-D exocentric. While navigating, participants had to avoid being seen by simulated enemy units. After the navigation task, participants' spatial awareness was assessed using a recognition task. RESULTS: The tethered displays minimized the time during which the participant's vehicle was visible to enemy positions. The egocentric display was more effective than exocentric displays (2-D or 3-D) for navigation, and the exocentric displays were more effective than egocentric for time seen during navigation and the recognition task. The tethered displays produced intermediate results for navigation and recognition. CONCLUSION: Viewpoint tethering produced the most effective displays for minimizing time seen, but tethered displays were less effective than egocentric and exocentric displays for navigation and recognition, respectively. APPLICATION: A tethered display is recommended for applications in which it is necessary to understand the relation of nearby locations to one's own location. Language: en","authors":["Justin G.

{"abstract":"Recent studies of youth aggression have emphasized the role of network-based peer influence processes. Other scholars have suggested that aggression is often motivated by status concerns. We integrate these two veins of research by considering the effects of peer status motivations on subsequent adolescent aggression, net of their own status motivations, prior aggression, and peer behavior. We also explore different levels at which peer effects may occur, considering the effects of reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships as well as larger, meso-level peer groups. We anticipate that peer group effects are magnified by both size and boundedness as measured by Freeman's (1972) Segregation Index. We find that, net of the adolescent's aggression at time 1, both the aggressive behaviors and the status valuations of friends independently increase the likelihood of aggression at time 2, six months later. The aggressive behavior of friends who do not reciprocate the adolescent's friendship nomination has particular impact. The average status valuation of peer groups increases their members' likelihood of aggression, even after controlling for their own attitudes about status, their friends' attitudes, and their friends' aggressive behavior. This effect is magnified in large groups and groups with high Freeman segregation scores. Language: en","authors":["Robert Faris","Susan T.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study contributes to human reliability analysis (HRA) by proposing a method that focuses more on human error causality within a sociotechnical system, illustrating its rationality and feasibility by using a case of the Minuteman (MM) III missile accident. BACKGROUND: Due to the complexity and dynamics within a sociotechnical system, previous analyses of accidents involving human and organizational factors clearly demonstrated that the methods using a sequential accident model are inadequate to analyze human error within a sociotechnical system. METHODS: System-theoretic accident model and processes (STAMP) was used to develop a universal framework of human error causal analysis. To elaborate the causal relationships and demonstrate the dynamics of human error, system dynamics (SD) modeling was conducted based on the framework. RESULTS: A total of 41 contributing factors, categorized into four types of human error, were identified through the STAMP-based analysis. All factors are related to a broad view of sociotechnical systems, and more comprehensive than the causation presented in the accident investigation report issued officially. Recommendations regarding both technical and managerial improvement for a lower risk of the accident are proposed. CONCLUSION: The interests of an interdisciplinary approach provide complementary support between system safety and human factors. The integrated method based on STAMP and SD model contributes to HRA effectively.

{"abstract":"This paper studies the space-time properties of locations that are critical to travel activities in an urban environment. Specifically, we analyze locations on the urban street network from the perspective of the distribution of people's travel trajectories. We identify the intersections of an urban transportation network which are characterized by good connectivity, serving a high density of trip trajectories, and exhibiting multiple traversing patterns of trip trajectories as potential functionally critical network locations (FCNLs). A geospatial method is proposed to extract FCNLs from people's moving trajectories based on the street network. Two groups of quantitative indices are introduced to measure the evolution of the spatial extent and temporal variation patterns of different criticality levels of FCNLs.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined operators' capacity to successfully reallocate highly autonomous in-flight missiles to time-sensitive targets while performing secondary tasks of varying complexity. BACKGROUND: Regardless of the level of autonomy for unmanned systems, humans will be necessarily involved in the mission planning, higher level operation, and contingency interventions, otherwise known as human supervisory control. As a result, more research is needed that addresses the impact of dynamic decision support systems that support rapid planning and replanning in time-pressured scenarios, particularly on operator workload. METHOD: A dual screen simulation that allows a single operator the ability to monitor and control 8, 12, or 16 missiles through high level replanning was tested on 42 U.S. Navy personnel. RESULTS: The most significant finding was that when attempting to control 16 missiles, participants' performance on three separate objective performance metrics and their situation awareness were significantly degraded. CONCLUSION: These results mirror studies of air traffic control that demonstrate a similar decline in performance for controllers managing 17 aircraft as compared with those managing only 10 to 11 aircraft. Moreover, the results suggest that a 70% utilization (percentage busy time) score is a valid threshold for predicting significant performance decay and could be a generalizable metric that can aid in manning predictions.

{"abstract":"This simulator-based study examined conventional auditory warnings (tonal, nonverbal sounds) and auditory icons (representational, nonverbal sounds), alone and in combination with a dash-mounted visual display, to present information about impending collision situations to commercial motor vehicle operators. Brake response times were measured for impending front-to-rear collision scenarios under 6 display configurations, 2 vehicle speeds, and 2 levels of headway. Accident occurrence was measured for impending side collision scenarios under 2 vehicle speeds, 2 levels of visual workload, 2 auditory displays, absence\/presence of mirrors, and absence\/presence of a dash-mounted iconic visual display. For both front-to-rear and side collision scenarios, auditory icons elicited significantly improved driver performance over conventional auditory warnings. Driver performance improved when collision warning information was presented through multiple modalities. Brake response times were significantly faster for impending front-to-rear collision scenarios using the longer headway condition. The presence of mirrors significantly reduced the number of accidents for impending side collision scenarios. Subjective preference data indicated that participants preferred multimodal displays over single-modality displays.

All participants reported experiencing significant difficulties with static and dynamic acuity, peripheral vision, illumination problems, and contrast sensitivity. Both nonimpaired and low-vision older adult drivers reported experiencing difficulty with glare, peripheral vision, and night driving. Low-vision drivers reported experiencing unique difficulties with near acuity, distant acuity, and physical obstructions. Potential applications of this research include suggestions for redesigning automobiles and highway signs for safer use and viewing.

{"abstract":"Error processing and conflict monitoring are essential executive functions for goal directed actions and adaptation to conflicting information. Although medial frontal regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in these functions, there is still considerable heterogeneity regarding their spatio-temporal activations. The timing of these functions has been associated with two separable event-related potentials (ERPs) usually localized to the medial frontal wall, one during error processing (ERN - error related negativity) and one during conflict monitoring (N2). In this study we aimed to spatially and temporally dissociate conflict and error processing using simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data from a modified Flanker task in healthy adults. We demonstrate a spatial dissociation of conflict monitoring and error processing along the medial frontal wall, with selective conflict level dependent activation of the SMA\/pre-SMA. Activation to error processing was located in the ACC, rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and pre-SMA. The EEG-informed fMRI analysis revealed that stronger ERN amplitudes are associated with increased activation in a large coherent cluster comprising the ACC, RCZ and pre-SMA, while N2 amplitudes increased with activation in the pre-SMA. Conjunction analysis of EEG-informed fMRI revealed common activation of ERN and N2 in the pre-SMA and divergent activation in the RCZ. No conjoint activation between error processing and conflict monitoring was found with standard fMRI analysis along the medial frontal wall. Our fMRI findings clearly demonstrate that conflict monitoring and error processing are spatially dissociable along the medial frontal wall. Moreover, the overlap of ERN- and N2-informed fMRI activation in the pre-SMA provides new evidence that these ERP components share conflict related processing functions and are thus not completely separable.

{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of Internet addiction in a nationally representative sample of college students and to identify any associated psychosocial risk factors. The present study was constructed using a cross-sectional design with 3,616 participants. Participants were surveyed during the middle of the spring and fall semesters and recruited from colleges around Taiwan using stratified and cluster random sampling methods. Associations between Internet addiction and psychosocial risk factors were examined using stepwise logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of Internet addiction was found to be 15.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 14.1 percent to 16.5 percent). More depressive symptoms, higher positive outcome expectancy of Internet use, higher Internet usage time, lower refusal self-efficacy of Internet use, higher impulsivity, lower satisfaction with academic performance, being male, and insecure attachment style were positively correlated with Internet addiction. The prevalence of Internet addiction among college students in Taiwan was high, and the variables mentioned were independently predictive in the logistic regression analysis. This study can be used as a reference for policy making regarding the design of Internet addiction prevention programs and can also aid in the development of strategies designed to help Internet-addicted college students.

{"abstract":"The present study tried to answer the research need for empirically validated and theoretically based instruments to assess cyberbullying and cybervictimization. The psychometric properties of the Florence CyberBullying-CyberVictimization Scales (FCBVSs) were analyzed in a sample of 1,142 adolescents (Mage=15.18 years; SD=1.12 years; 54.5% male). For both cybervictimization and cyberbullying, results support a gender invariant model involving 14 items and four factors covering four types of behaviors (written-verbal, visual, impersonation, and exclusion). The second-order confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that a \"global,\" second-order measure of cyberbullying and cybervictimization fits the data well. Overall, the scales showed good validity (construct, concurrent, and convergent) and reliability (internal consistency and test-retest). In addition, using the global key question measure as a criterion, ROC analyses, determining the ability of a test to discriminate between groups, allowed us to identify cutoff points to classify respondents as involved\/not involved starting from the continuum measure derived from the scales.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study used a neuroergonomic approach to examine the interaction of mental and physical fatigue by assessing prefrontal cortex activation during submaximal fatiguing handgrip exercises. BACKGROUND: Mental fatigue is known to influence muscle function and motor performance, but its contribution to the development of voluntary physical fatigue is not well understood. METHOD: A total of 12 participants performed separate physical (control) and physical and mental fatigue (concurrent) conditions at 30% of their maximal handgrip strength until exhaustion. Functional near infrared spectroscopy was employed to measure prefrontal cortex activation, whereas electromyography and joint steadiness were used simultaneously to quantify muscular effort. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, blood oxygenation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex was significantly lower during submaximal fatiguing contractions associated with mental fatigue at exhaustion, despite comparable muscular responses. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that interference in the prefrontal cortex may influence motor output during tasks that require both physical and cognitive processing.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the visual discrimination speed and accuracy while using an LCD and a CRT display. BACKGROUND: LCDs have ergonomic advantages, but their main disadvantage is that they provide inconsistent photometric measures depending on the viewing angle (anisotropy). METHOD: Independent variables were screen type (LCD and CRT), viewing angle (0 degrees, 11 degrees, 41 degrees, 50 degrees, and 56 degrees) and user's age (teenagers, young adults, and middle-aged adults). Dependent variables were speed and accuracy in a visual discrimination task and user's ratings. RESULTS: The results corroborated the negative impact of LCD anisotropy. Visual discrimination times were by 7.6% slower when an LCD was used instead of a CRT. Performance differences increased with increasing viewing angle for both screens, but performance decrements were larger for the LCD. Young adults showed the best visual performance, as compared with teenagers and middle-aged adults. Effects of anisotropy were found for all age groups, although the performance of middle-aged adults was affected more when extended viewing angles were adopted. CONCLUSION: LCD anisotropy is a limiting factor for visual performance, especially in work settings where fast and accurate reactions are necessary.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present research tests the effects of time pressure and noise on open-mindedness to discover new problem-solving strategies. BACKGROUND: We are primarily interested in transfer of skill from one phase to the next. More specifically, this study investigates whether the presence of stressors makes participants adhere to the sustained use of complex rules. METHOD: Participants learned to apply a complex rule in the first phase of a category learning task. In the second phase, this rule became dysfunctional and participants had to search for a new categorization rule in order to assign the stimuli to the correct classes. Two experiments were set up to investigate this issue. RESULTS: Participants were found to have difficulty discovering a complex Phase 2 rule in the presence of stressors, whereas the discovery of a simple rule was not hindered by the presence of stressors. CONCLUSION: In the discussion, it is argued that the present results are compatible with previous research on stressors showing that time pressure and noise induce the application of simple strategies. The innovative finding here is that this simplification also occurs in individuals who are accustomed to using complex solutions.

The cost of incompatibility on performance is often much greater for older than for younger adults. To design products that accommodate decreased response selection capabilities of older adults, designers need to understand the specific ways in which response selection processes change with age. The purpose of the present paper is to review research on age-related changes in stimulus-response compatibility and response precuing effects, the two effects that are most directly linked to basic response selection processes. Several specific aspects of response selection that are particularly harmful for older adults' performance are identified.

{"abstract":"Pathological Internet use (PIU) occurs when excessive Internet use results in addictive symptoms that exert detrimental consequences on one's overall functioning and well-being. Poor family functioning has been found to be associated with youths' addictive Internet use, and parental use of active and restrictive mediation has been found to reduce online risk. The current study aims to test if parental active and restrictive mediation strategies are negatively associated with youths' PIU. Additionally, it also tests the effectiveness of these strategies as a function of the broader family environment with measures of parent-child attachment, family communication, and the youth's comfort with living at home. The data of 3,079 students in Singapore were analyzed through a series of logistic regressions. The results revealed that the family environment for students with PIU was significantly less positive. Only restrictive mediation was found to be negatively associated with PIU. This relation was stronger for higher levels of attachment, communication, and comfort at home, implying that the effectiveness of restrictive mediation varies with the degree of warmth and support in the general family environment.

BACKGROUND: ARTT has been shown to improve transfer to the criterion task in some military simulation experiments. We tested training speed and screen resolution in a project, sponsored by Defence Research and Development Canada, to develop components for prototype air mission simulators. METHOD: For this study, 54 participants used a single-screen PC-based flight simulation program to learn to chase and catch an F-18A fighter jet with another F-18A while controlling the chase aircraft with a throttle and side-stick controller. Screen resolution was varied between participants, and training speed was varied factorially across two sessions within participants. Pretest and posttest trials were at high resolution and criterion (900 knots) speed. RESULTS: Posttest performance was best with high screen resolution training and when one ARTT training session was followed by a session of criterion speed training. CONCLUSION: ARTT followed by criterion training improves performance on a visual-motor coordination task. We think that ARTT influences known facilitators of transfer, including similarity to the criterion task and contextual interference.

{"abstract":"Injury from blunt head impacts causes acute neurological deficits and may lead to chronic neurodegeneration. A head impact detection device can serve both as a research tool for studying head injury mechanisms and a clinical tool for real-time trauma screening. The simplest approach is an acceleration thresholding algorithm, which may falsely detect high-acceleration spurious events such as manual manipulation of the device. We designed a head impact detection system that distinguishes head impacts from non-impacts through two subsystems. First, we use infrared proximity sensing to determine if the mouthguard is worn on the teeth to filter out all offteeth events. Second, on-teeth, non-impact events are rejected using a support vector machine classifier trained on frequency domain features of linear acceleration and rotational velocity. The remaining events are classified as head impacts. In a controlled laboratory evaluation, the present system performed substantially better than a 10g acceleration threshold in head impact detection (98% sensitivity, 99.99% specificity, 99% accuracy, and 99.98% precision, compared to 92% sensitivity, 58% specificity, 65% accuracy, and 37% precision). Once adapted for field deployment by training and validation with field data, this system has the potential to effectively detect head trauma in sports, military service, and other high-risk activities.

{"abstract":"The working environment of railways is challenging and complex and often involves high-risk operations which affect both the company staff and inhabitants of the towns and cities alongside the railway lines. Rail companies adopt several strategies to reduce the exposure to risk of their employees and the public, which involve having trained personnel, safety technologies and work practices. However, despite this, railways remain high-risk operations and unfortunate incidents still occur. In this paper a visual analytics system is employed to help in the management of railway safety. This system is based on a data analytics workflow to compile an incident risk index which processes information that has been collated with regard to incidents along the railway tracks. The results of this data analytics workflow (i.e. incident risk index) are then displayed in a visual form in a geographical map together with socioeconomic information about the towns and cities concerned. Feedback on this visual analytics system suggests that it can be used by safety engineers and specialists when making decisions and communicating these decisions.

BACKGROUND: The implementation of nonvisual in-car warning signals may have important safety implications in lessening any visual overload during driving. Multisensory integration can provide synergistic facilitation effects.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of intermittent task parameters on muscle fatigue and endurance time during static shoulder abductions, with a long-term goal of establishing relationships between intermittent task parameters and short-term performance. BACKGROUND: Effects of intermittent work on endurance and fatigue development have been reported, and certain combinations of contraction levels and duty cycles have been proposed as design guidelines. These findings, however, were not derived from systematic manipulations of the task parameters. METHOD: Prolonged (1-hr maximum) intermittent shoulder abductions were performed at different combinations of contraction level (12% or 28% of muscle strength), duty cycle (.25 or .75), and cycle time (34 or 166 s). Fatigue was measured based on reductions in muscle strength and indirectly by changes in ratings of discomfort, electromyographic (EMG) amplitude, and EMG spectral distribution. RESULTS: Contraction level and duty cycle significantly affected endurance time and muscle fatigue, and interactive effects between these parameters were observed for some of the measures. Significant effects of cycle time were found only for EMG spectral measures. CONCLUSION: Endurance time and local fatigue were dependent on the comprehensive effects of the different task parameters.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Handgrip is a ubiquitous human movement that was critical in our evolution. However, the differences in brain activity between grip type (i.e. power or precision) and pattern (i.e. dynamic or static) are not fully understood. In order to address this, we performed Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis between grip type and grip pattern using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. ALE provides a probabilistic summary of the BOLD response in hundreds of subjects, which is often beyond the scope of a single fMRI experiment. METHODS: We collected data from 28 functional magnetic resonance data sets, which included a total of 398 male and female subjects. Using ALE, we analyzed the BOLD response during power, precision, static and dynamic grip in a range of forces and age in right handed healthy individuals without physical impairment, cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction using a variety of grip tools, feedback and experimental training. RESULTS: Power grip generates unique activation in the postcentral gyrus (area 1 and 3b) and precision grip generates unique activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA, area 6) and precentral gyrus (area 4a). Dynamic handgrip generates unique activation in the precentral gyrus (area 4p) and SMA (area 6) and of particular interest, both dynamic and static grip share activation in the area 2 of the postcentral gyrus, an area implicated in the evolution of handgrip. According to effect size analysis, precision and dynamic grip generates stronger activity than power and static, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates specific differences between grip type and pattern. However, there was a large degree of overlap in the pre and postcentral gyrus, SMA and areas of the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network, which indicates that other mechanisms are potentially involved in regulating handgrip. Further, our study provides empirically based regions of interest, which can be downloaded here within, that can be used to more effectively study power grip in a range of populations and conditions.

{"abstract":"Gang members carry guns and twitter accounts. Media outlets nationally have reported on a new phenomenon of gang affiliates using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to trade insults or make violence threats that lead homicide or victimization. We term this interaction internet banging. Police departments in metropolitan areas have increased resources in their gang violence units to combat this issue. Interestingly, there is little to no literature on this issue. We argue internet banging is a cultural phenomenon that has evolved from increased participation with social media and represents an adaptive structuration, or new and unintended use of existing online social media. We examine internet banging within the context of gang violence, paying close attention to the mechanisms and processes that may explain how and why internet banging has evolved. We examine the role of hip-hop in the development of internet banging and highlight the changing roles of both hip hop and computer mediated communication as social representations of life in violent communities. We explore the presentation of urban masculinity and its influence on social media behavior. Lastly, we conduct a textual analysis of music and video content that demonstrates violent responses to virtual interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated skill development and workload of pilots driving teleoperated unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through different apertures and viewpoints using the cornering law. BACKGROUND: Due to technological and cost restraints, humans are still needed for tasks involving UGVs. Operators of teleoperated UGVs are likely to have less situation awareness and thus are more prone to getting stuck or damaged when negotiating apertures.To our knowledge, the operation of physical UGVs through corners has not been examined. Therefore, a better understanding of cornering a teleoperated UGVs is imperative. METHOD: In Experiment 1, 20 novice participants repeatedly teleoperated a physical UGV using a third-person overhead view through apertures that varied in width. In Experiment 2, 18 additional novice participants completed a similar task but used a first-person view. RESULTS: Participants' performance increased (i.e., faster cornering times and less collisions) over sessions. The cornering law successfully modeled the effect of different aperture widths on participant performance for both viewing perspectives. CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully modeled human performance of teleoperated UGVs using the cornering law. Analogous to Fitts' and steering law, we were able to successfully model and predict cornering performance based on a derived index of cornering difficulty. APPLICATION: The cornering law could be used to aid in the development of prototype user interfaces and also to examine the effects of different teleoperation views (first person vs. third person).

Sharing of management information, creating social capital for safety promotion, and injury data recording were found to be key areas that need to be further supported by computer-based information systems. Most respondents reported having access to a personal computer workstation with standard office software.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research evaluated the effects of an advance warning device (AWD) on the safety of driver interactions with emergency vehicles (EVs). The AWD was intended to provide drivers with advance warning of an approaching on-call EV via visual and auditory warnings when the EV was within a 300- to 400-m radius. BACKGROUND: Research suggests that drivers can experience difficulty accurately detecting the distance and direction of approaching on-call EV. In-vehicle technology has not previously been explored as a means of overcoming the limitations of existing EV lights and sirens and improving driver detection of EV. METHOD: An experimental study using an advanced driving simulator examined the effects of the AWD on driving performance in a range of circumstances in which real-world EV crashes and near-misses commonly occur. Each event contained a combination of scenario type (adjacent lane, turning across, car following) and warning condition (control, standard, advance). RESULTS: Data from 22 participants were collected, including measures of speed, braking, and visual scanning. For adjacent-lane and turning-across events, the AWD was associated primarily with reductions in mean speed. The AWD resulted in an earlier lane change to clear a path for the EV in the car-following event. CONCLUSION: The reduction in speed observed was a positive finding, given the relationship between impact speed and injury severity. Response priming emerged as the mechanism underpinning these effects. Application: Response priming may result in safety benefits in other settings when an advisory warning is presented before the threat can be perceived. Language: en","authors":["Michael G.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the studies was to examine the role of implicit processes in aeronautical risk perception and risk taking. BACKGROUND: Aeronautical decision making consists of both explicit processes (e.g., comparing options, seeking information) and implicit, or intuitive, processes (e.g., immediate affective reactions). The present studies utilized a novel methodology, adapted from studies in social cognition, to examine the relationship between general aviation pilots' implicit reactions toward risk and their involvement in hazardous events. METHOD: The Implicit Association Test was used to measure pilots' (Study 1: N= 23; Study 2: N= 32) implicit associations between good and bad weather conditions and perceptions of risk and anxiety. RESULTS: There was a relationship between the pilots' implicit perceptions and previous involvement in hazardous aeronautical events as measured by D. R. Hunter's (1995, 2002) Hazardous Events Scale. The more weather-related hazardous events the pilots had been involved in, the less they associated implicit risk with adverse weather (Study 1) and the less implicitly anxious they were toward adverse weather (Study 2). CONCLUSION: The results show a relationship between implicit associations and risk-taking behavior. APPLICATION: Pilots may be involved in risk-taking behavior because they perceive less risk in, and are implicitly less afraid of, hazardous conditions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of operational variables on diagnosis and decision-making processes, focusing on information search. BACKGROUND: Arguably, the\"best\"decision-making processes in high-technology cockpits would be those that are both correspondent (objectively accurate) and coherent (rationally sound). In the electronic world, coherence in terms of identification and incorporation of all relevant information is both a prerequisite to and a limiting factor for accurate diagnosis and decision making. METHOD: Regional carrier pilots (N=93) responded to six scenarios by accessing information to determine a diagnosis and decision. RESULTS: Time pressure, a common operational variable, had a strong negative effect on information search and diagnosis accuracy, and the presence of noncongruent information heightened these negative effects. Unexpectedly, source of initial information (automated or other) did not impact any of the dependent variables. Diagnosis confidence was unrelated to accuracy and was negatively related to amount of information accessed. CONCLUSION: Results confirm both the need for coherence in diagnostic processes and the difficulty of maintaining it under time pressure. APPLICATION: One implication of the results of this study is that pilots in high-technology cockpits must be trained to utilize coherent diagnostic processes as standard operating procedure. Additionally, because thorough information search for diagnosis in an automated environment is essential, automated systems must be designed to foster coherent, and thus accurate, diagnostic processes.

{"abstract":"Existing approaches that explain the behavior of workers in noisy environments rarely include quantitative variables related to central factors such as noise exposure levels and workers' hearing status. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship among individual, contextual, and perceptual-cognitive factors and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). We studied 516 industrial workers exposed to noise levels greater than the Portuguese action level and developed a conceptual model for HPD use. The multivariate data analysis of the several variables considered revealed that individual risk perception and the outcome value for hearing preservation were the main direct predictors of the use of HPDs. Workers' opinions about the company's safety climate and their perception of noise exposure effects also play important roles as predictors. However, much of the effects of these factors are indirect (i.e., mediated by other variables). Furthermore, these results suggest that risk perception should be considered an essential issue in the design and implementation of any hearing conservation program, particularly in the development of training programs. Actual or potential applications of this research include the definition of more accurate strategies for promoting and motivating the use of HPDs. Language: en","authors":["P. Arezes","A.

In addition to recovering from physical wounds, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorders, many soldiers also face basic psychological issues about who they are and how to find their place in a society that has not shared their experiences. To address these challenges, we have created a space that provides ongoing opportunities for healing activities, personal exploration and social camaraderie in an online virtual world, Second Life. In such worlds, where each avatar is controlled by a live individual, experiences can be unintuitive, uninviting, considered boring, or difficult to control.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Haptic shared control was investigated as a human-machine interface that can intuitively share control between drivers and an automatic controller for curve negotiation. BACKGROUND: As long as automation systems are not fully reliable, a role remains for the driver to be vigilant to the system and the environment to catch any automation errors. The conventional binary switches between supervisory and manual control has many known issues, and haptic shared control is a promising alternative. METHOD: A total of 42 respondents of varying age and driving experience participated in a driving experiment in a fixed-base simulator, in which curve negotiation behavior during shared control was compared to during manual control, as well as to three haptic tunings of an automatic controller without driver intervention. RESULTS: Under the experimental conditions studied, the main beneficial effect of haptic shared control compared to manual control was that less control activity (16% in steering wheel reversal rate, 15% in standard deviation of steering wheel angle) was needed for realizing an improved safety performance (e.g., 11% in peak lateral error). Full automation removed the need for any human control activity and improved safety performance (e.g., 35% in peak lateral error) but put the human in a supervisory position. CONCLUSION: Haptic shared control kept the driver in the loop, with enhanced performance at reduced control activity, mitigating the known issues that plague full automation. APPLICATION: Haptic support for vehicular control ultimately seeks to intuitively combine human intelligence and creativity with the benefits of automation systems.

{"abstract":"Prior research on the psychology of retribution is complicated by the difficulty of separating retributive and general deterrence motives when studying human offenders (Study 1). We isolate retribution by investigating judgments about punishing animals, which allows us to remove general deterrence from consideration. Studies 2 and 3 document a \"victim identity\" effect, such that the greater the perceived loss from a violent animal attack, the greater the belief that the culprit deserves to be killed. Study 3 documents a \"targeted punishment\" effect, such that the responsive killing of the actual \"guilty\" culprit is seen as more deserved than the killing of an almost identical yet \"innocent\" animal from the same species. Studies 4 and 5 extend both effects to participants' acceptance of inflicting pain and suffering on the offending animal at the time of its death, and show that both effects are mediated by measures of retributive sentiment, and not by consequentialist concerns.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Pre-synaptic D2 receptors regulate striatal dopamine release and DAT activity, key factors for modulation of motor pathways. A functional SNP of DRD2 (rs1076560 G>T) is associated with alternative splicing such that the relative expression of D2S (mainly pre-synaptic) vs. D2L (mainly post-synaptic) receptor isoforms is decreased in subjects with the T allele with a putative increase of striatal dopamine levels. To evaluate how DRD2 genotype and striatal dopamine signaling predict motor cortical activity and behavior in humans, we have investigated the association of rs1076560 with BOLD fMRI activity during a motor task. To further evaluate the relationship of this circuitry with dopamine signaling, we also explored the correlation between genotype based differences in motor brain activity and pre-synaptic striatal DAT binding measured with [(123)I] FP-CIT SPECT. METHODS: Fifty healthy subjects, genotyped for DRD2 rs1076560 were studied with BOLD-fMRI at 3T while performing a visually paced motor task with their right hand; eleven of these subjects also underwent [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT. SPM5 random-effects models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele had greater BOLD responses in left basal ganglia, thalamus, supplementary motor area, and primary motor cortex, whose activity was also negatively correlated with reaction time at the task. Moreover, left striatal DAT binding and activity of left supplementary motor area were negatively correlated. INTERPRETATION: The present results suggest that DRD2 genetic variation was associated with focusing of responses in the whole motor network, in which activity of predictable nodes was correlated with reaction time and with striatal pre-synaptic dopamine signaling. Our results in humans may help shed light on genetic risk for neurobiological mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of disorders with dysregulation of striatal dopamine like Parkinson's Disease.

{"abstract":"Twenty women were asked to generate forces using a dynamometer that were consistent with one of three different work-rest schedules (a low-, medium-, and high-force schedule). Each work-rest schedule consisted of 6 identical blocks of 10 work-rest cycles. Each of the 10 work-rest cycles lasted 1 min. The first work-rest cycle in each block consisted of a 6-s maximal voluntary contraction and a 54-s rest. The remaining 9 work-rest cycles in each block consisted of a submaximal contraction and a rest period. The desired force of the submaximal contraction, the length of this contraction, and the duration of the rest period remained constant within schedules but varied across schedules. The amount of physiological work was kept constant among schedules. The fatigue that developed in the medium-force schedule was significantly lower than that developed in either the low- or high-force schedule. A model was developed that predicted the amount of fatiguable strength at the beginning and end of each contraction of a work-rest cycle. When fit to the results from the experiment, the model explained 94% of the variance. The model can be used to predict the work-rest schedule that minimizes fatigue in a given repetitive job, thereby potentially increasing productivity and reducing the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this article, I present the ideas and trends that have given rise to the use of cognitive architectures in human factors and provide a cognitive engineering-oriented taxonomy of these architectures and a snapshot of their use for cognitive engineering. BACKGROUND: Architectures of cognition have had a long history in human factors but a brief past. The long history entails a 50-year preamble, whereas the explosion of work in the current decade reflects the brief past. Understanding this history is key to understanding the current and future prospects for applying cognitive science theory to human factors practice. METHOD: The review defines three formative eras in cognitive engineering research: the 1950s, 1980s, and now. RESULTS: In the first era, the fledging fields of cognitive science and human factors emphasized characteristics of the dancer the limited capacity or bounded rationality view of the mind, and the ballroom, the task environment. The second era emphasized the dance (i.e., the dynamic interaction between mental operations and task environment). The third era has seen the rise of cognitive architectures as tools for choreographing the dance of mental operations within the complex environments posed by human factors practice. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid architectures present the best vector for introducing cognitive science theories into a renewed engineering-based human factors.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We present a snapshot of the work on situation awareness, which involves operators' comprehension of the dynamic situation that they are monitoring or controlling. BACKGROUND: Although human factors has always been concerned with helping the operator in his or her work environment, research exploded in the mid-1990s on one relevant construct, situation awareness. METHOD: We discuss how a distinction present years ago, the product of comprehension versus the process of comprehension, not only continues today but characterizes different research directions. Research on situation awareness has benefited and can continue to benefit from an analogy to the better understood comprehension of narrative and expository text, although such an analogy between text and dynamic environments will ultimately have limits. RESULTS: Situation awareness as a notion that organizes and focuses research efforts has rightfully spread to research in virtually every industrial domain, and it is an essential part of work on automation and design. CONCLUSION: Work on situation awareness has had a ubiquitous influence on cognitive engineering and has even pushed the envelope of basic cognitive psychology into dynamic domains. APPLICATION: Considering situation awareness is also important in cognitive ergonomic issues relevant to training, teamwork, and the design of new human-technical systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine if a wearable system based on a head-mounted display (HMD) causes users to alter their head position and adopt postures that place greater stress on the musculoskeletal system. BACKGROUND: HMDs are common output devices used with wearable computers. HMDs provide the wearer with visual information by projecting computer-generated virtual images in front of the eyes. Deviations of neck posture from a neutral upright position increase the stresses on the musculoskeletal system of the head and neck. METHOD: Seven paramedics simulated the treatment of a patient under a normal condition and when using an HMD wearable computer system. During the simulations a posture analysis was performed using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment method. RESULTS: The postures adopted when wearing an HMD, as compared with a normal condition, scored significantly higher for the neck (z = 2.463, p < .05) and for overall body posture (left side of the body: z = 2.447, p < .05; right side of the body: z = 2.895, p < .05). CONCLUSION: Wearing an HMD can force the wearers to modify their neck posture. As such, the musculoskeletal system of the head and neck may be placed under increased levels of stress. APPLICATION: Potential users should be made aware that HMDs could dictate modifications in neck posture, which may have detrimental effects and may compound the weight effect of the HMD.

{"abstract":"When people simultaneously draw lines with one hand and circles with the other hand, both trajectories tend to assume an oval shape, showing that hand motor programs interact (the so-called \"bimanual coupling effect\"). The aim of the present study was to investigate how motor parameters (drawing trajectories) and the related brain activity vary during bimanual movements both in real execution and in motor imagery tasks. In the 'Real' modality, subjects performed right hand movements (lines) and, simultaneously, Congruent (lines) or Non-congruent (circles) left hand movements. In the 'Imagery' modality, subjects performed only right hand movements (lines) and, simultaneously, imagined Congruent (lines) or Non-congruent (circles) left hand movements. Behavioral results showed similar interference of both the real and the imagined circles on the actually executed lines, suggesting that the coupling effect also pertains to motor imagery. Neuroimaging results showed that a prefrontal-parietal network, mostly involving the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), was significantly more active in Non-congruent than in Congruent conditions, irrespective of task (Real or Imagery). The data also confirmed specific roles of the right superior parietal lobe (SPL) in mediating spatial interference, and of the left PPC in motor imagery. Collectively, these findings suggest that real and imagined non-congruent movements activate common circuits related to the intentional and predictive operation generating bimanual coupling, in which the pre-SMA and the PPC play a crucial role.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study explored the potential for auditory and haptic spatial cuing approaches to alert drivers to the direction of a crash threat. BACKGROUND: For an automobile equipped with multiple crash avoidance systems, effective cuing of the crash threat direction may help the driver avoid the crash. Because the driver may not be looking in the direction of a visual crash alert, nonvisual crash alerts were explored as an additional means of directing attention to a potential crash situation. METHODS: In this in-traffic study, 32 drivers were asked to verbally report alert direction in the absence of any crash threats. Driver localization accuracy and response time were examined as a function of eight alert locations surrounding the vehicle and four directional alert approaches (auditory, haptic, haptic and auditory, and haptic and nondirectional auditory). The auditory directional alert approach used four speakers and broadband alert sounds, and the haptic directional alert approach used vibrations generated at various locations on the bottom of the driver's seat. RESULTS: Overall, relative to the auditory alert approach, the three approaches that included the haptic seat alert component reduced correct localization response times by 257 ms and increased percentage correct localization from 32% to 84%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that seat vibration alerts are a promising candidate for alerting drivers to the direction of a crash threat. APPLICATION: These findings should facilitate developing a multimodality integrated crash alert approach for vehicles equipped with multiple crash avoidance systems.

{"abstract":"The relative contribution of number of fixations and fixation duration to reaction time in visual search was investigated. Ten participants (age 20-24 years) took part in each of two experiments. In Experiment 1, the experimental factors were display type (icon and file name), organization (arrangements with and without grouping), and number of stimuli presented (4, 8, and 16). In Experiment 2, a search task for a target stimulus (three prespecified random letters) was conducted, and the experimental factor was the display's layout complexity. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine whether reaction time was explained by a mediational model in which reaction time is mediated by eye movements and display features are not directly related to reaction time. The mediational model was not supported, and the effects of display features on reaction time were not attributable solely to eye movements. The interaction between number of fixations and fixation duration was also explored as a function of display features. As the display feature changed and the task became more difficult, the contribution of the number of fixations to explain the variation in reaction time became dominant for both experiments. Potential applications include measurements of cognitive ability, eye muscle balance disorders, and binocular fusion ability.

{"abstract":"The modeling of eco-driving behaviors is a key issue in the research of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Most efforts have been made regarding internal combustion vehicles, and few works have been reported in the field of electric vehicles. On the other hand, these behavior analyses are usually conducted through naturalistic driving researches that involve the use of instrumented vehicles, available in a small number, which reduces the impact of the results. This paper presents a system for estimating the remaining charge of an electric vehicle by considering the driving behavior measured using a smartphone. For this purpose, first of all, data measured by the smartphone and by the onboard instrumentation were compared in order to demonstrate that both sources are equivalent and that the former is sufficiently accurate. The driving profiles obtained were then used to estimate the expected battery consumption of the electric vehicle using a Neural Network to represent the model that uses the information provided from the smartphone as input, such as speed, acceleration and jerk. The system has been tested with 10 drivers with a prediction capability of the expected battery consumption higher than 95%. These results show that a smartphone is a tool with a sufficient degree of fidelity to capture data from drivers, and so avoid expensive, complex systems like instrumented vehicles, and it can also be used for estimating energy consumption and predicting the remaining battery charge.

{"abstract":"The role of sensory information in motor control has been studied, but the cortical processing underlying cross-modal relationship between visual and somatosensory information for movement execution remains a matter of debate. Visual estimates of limb positions are congruent with proprioceptive estimates under normal visual conditions, but a mismatch between the watched and felt movement of the hand disrupts motor execution. We investigated whether activation in somatosensory areas was affected by the discordance between the intended and an executed action. Subjects performed self-paced thumb movement of the left hand under normal visual and mirror conditions. The Mirror condition provided a non-veridical and unexpected visual feedback. The results showed activity in the primary somatosensory area to be inhibited and activity in the secondary somatosensory area (SII) to be enhanced with voluntary movement, and neural responses in the SII and parietal cortex were strongly affected by the unexpected visual feedback. These results provide evidence that the visual information plays a crucial role in activation in somatosensory areas during motor execution. A mechanism that monitors sensory inputs and motor outputs congruent with current intension is necessary to control voluntary movement.

{"abstract":"Groups of activated neurons typically synchronize in the gamma-frequency band (30-100Hz), and gamma-band synchronization has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions. Those functions are ultimately expressed as behavior and therefore, functional gamma-band synchronization should be directly related to behavior. We recorded the magnetoencephalogram in human subjects and used a visual stimulus to induce occipital gamma-band activity. We found that the strength of this gamma-band activity at a given moment predicted the speed with which the subject was able to report a change in the stimulus. This predictive effect was restricted in time, frequency and space: It started only around 200ms before the behaviorally relevant stimulus change, was present only between 50 and 80Hz, and was significant only in bilateral middle occipital gyrus, while the peak of overall visually induced gamma-band activity was found in the calcarine sulcus. These results suggest that visually induced gamma-band activity is functionally relevant for the efficient transmission of stimulus change information to brain regions issuing the corresponding motor response.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Effects of four types of automation support and two levels of automation reliability were examined. The objective was to examine the differential impact of information and decision automation and to investigate the costs of automation unreliability. BACKGROUND: Research has shown that imperfect automation can lead to differential effects of stages and levels of automation on human performance. Method: Eighteen participants performed a\"sensor to shooter\"targeting simulation of command and control. Dependent variables included accuracy and response time of target engagement decisions, secondary task performance, and subjective ratings of mental work-load, trust, and self-confidence. RESULTS: Compared with manual performance, reliable automation significantly reduced decision times. Unreliable automation led to greater cost in decision-making accuracy under the higher automation reliability condition for three different forms of decision automation relative to information automation. At low automation reliability, however, there was a cost in performance for both information and decision automation. CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with a model of human-automation interaction that requires evaluation of the different stages of information processing to which automation support can be applied. APPLICATION: If fully reliable decision automation cannot be guaranteed, designers should provide users with information automation support or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of raw data.

{"abstract":"Emergency management is a diverse field. Effective disaster management involves knowledge of various subjects as well as work experience in all aspects related to mitigation, planning, response, and recovery efforts. One field not being fully exploited by disaster management is the use of geospatial tools in the form of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography, and geovisualization. One reason for this is that many emergency managers are not fully aware of the assistance GIS can lend to effectively manage disaster situations. All functions of emergency management have a strong geographic component. Where is the earthquake epicenter? Where is the damage? Where does the dam inundation run and who\/what is in that path? Where is the area of road closures? The questions asking \"where\" are endless in effective emergency management and range from the mitigation stage through to the recovery stage. For example, a tsunami may inundate only a certain portion of the region, therefore, it is important to have mitigation and planning efforts concentrated in those regions. It is also important to know what businesses, housing, and populations are in the affected areas. The integration of geospatial tools for risk assessment, mitigation, planning, response, and recovery efforts is emerging as an effective and potentially invaluable resource for answering such questions in regards to emergency management.

{"abstract":"Is there one optimal topology of functional brain networks at rest from which our cognitive performance would profit? Previous studies suggest that functional integration of resting state brain networks is an important biomarker for cognitive performance. However, it is still unknown whether higher network integration is an unspecific predictor for good cognitive performance or, alternatively, whether specific network organization during rest predicts only specific cognitive abilities. Here, we investigated the relationship between network integration at rest and cognitive performance using two tasks that measured different aspects of working memory; one task assessed visual-spatial and the other numerical working memory. Network clustering, modularity and efficiency were computed to capture network integration on different levels of network organisation, and to statistically compare their correlations with the performance in each working memory test. The results revealed that each working memory aspect profits from a different resting state topology, and the tests showed significantly different correlations with each of the measures of network integration. While higher global network integration and modularity predicted significantly better performance in visual-spatial working memory, both measures showed no significant correlation with numerical working memory performance. In contrast, numerical working memory was superior in subjects with highly clustered brain networks, predominantly in the intraparietal sulcus, a core brain region of the working memory network. Our findings suggest that a specific balance between local and global functional integration of resting state brain networks facilitates special aspects of cognitive performance. In the context of working memory, while visual-spatial performance is facilitated by globally integrated functional resting state brain networks, numerical working memory profits from increased capacities for local processing, especially in brain regions involved in working memory performance.

{"abstract":"The event-related potential (ERP) literature described two error-related brain activities: the error-related negativity (Ne\/ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), peaking immediately after the erroneous response. ERP studies on error processing adopted a response-locked approach, thus, the question about the activities preceding the error is still open. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the activities preceding the false alarms (FA) are different from those occurring in the correct (responded or inhibited) trials. To this aim, we studied a sample of 36 Go\/No-go performers, adopting a stimulus-locked segmentation also including the pre-motor brain activities. Present results showed that neither pre-stimulus nor perceptual activities explain why we commit FA. In contrast, we observed condition-related differences in two pre-response components: the fronto-central N2 and the prefrontal positivity (pP), respectively peaking at 250ms and 310ms after the stimulus onset. The N2 amplitude of FA was identical to that recorded in No-go trials, and larger than Hits. Because the new findings challenge the previous interpretations on the N2, a new perspective is discussed. On the other hand, the pP in the FA trials was larger than No-go and smaller than Go, suggesting an erroneous processing at the stimulus-response mapping level: because this stage triggers the response execution, we concluded that the neural processes underlying the pP were mainly responsible for the subsequent error commission. Finally, sLORETA source analyses of the post-error potentials extended previous findings indicating, for the first time in the ERP literature, the right anterior insula as Pe generator.

{"abstract":"Hostility online has not been evaluated by an empirical investigation. This study aims to evaluate (a) the difference between hostility in the real world and that online and (b) whether the difference is associated with Internet addiction, depression, or online activities. A total of 2,348 college students (1,124 males and 1,224 females) were recruited and completed the Chen Internet Addiction Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale, and the questionnaire for online activity. Further, the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory-Chinese version-short form was utilized to evaluate hostility in both real and virtual worlds. The results demonstrated that the levels of all four dimensions of hostility were lower when getting online than those in the real world. Subjects with Internet addiction had higher hostility both in the real world and online as do subjects with depression. Further, college students with Internet addiction had increased expressive hostility behavior and those with depression had decreased hostility cognition, hostility affection, and suppressive hostility behavior when getting online. Lastly, the buffering effect of the Internet on hostility was attenuated among subjects paying the most online time in chatting, and those using the Internet mainly for online gaming had higher expressive hostility behavior not only in the real world but also online. These results suggest that attention should be paid to interventions concerning aggressive behavior among subjects with Internet addiction or online gaming and chatting. On the other hand, depressed college students would be less hostile after entering the Internet. It is suggested that the Internet would be one possible interactive media to provide intervention for depression.

{"abstract":"Alex Green was a pioneering operations analyst\/researcher for the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. His February 1945 operations analysis \"Report on the Combat Performance of the Remote Control Turrets of B-29 Aircraft\" was classified and buried for 70 years. Stationed in the China-Burma-India theatre and addressing a problem of combat losses posed by General Curtis LeMay, Green used written reports and interviews to draw conclusions regarding direction of enemy attack on the B-29s, opposite those of a large stateside simulation study. Resulting in LeMay's changes in B-29 flight formations and frontal armaments, his report also addressed B-29 gun dispersion adjustments and modifications to the analog computer in the plane's nose. This paper examines how Green drew his conclusions under wartime conditions before digital computers. Apart from the extraordinary advances in computer technology, much of his methodology is still relevant today and a part of operations research (OR).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study developed and tested a model of car following by human drivers. BACKGROUND: Previous models of car following are based on 3-D parameters such as lead vehicle speed and distance information, which are not directly available to a driver. In the present paper we present the driving by visual angle (DVA) model, which is based on the visual information (visual angle and rate of change of visual angle) available to the driver. METHOD: Two experiments in a driving simulator examined car-following performance in response to speed variations of a lead vehicle defined by a sum of sine wave oscillations and ramp acceleration functions. In addition, the model was applied to six driving events using real world-driving data. RESULTS: The model provided a good fit to car-following performance in the driving simulation studies as well as in real-world driving performance. A comparison with the advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN) model, which is based on 3-D parameters, suggests that the DVA was more predictive of driver behavior in matching lead vehicle speed and distance headway. CONCLUSION: Car-following behavior can be modeled using only visual information to the driver and can produce performance more predictive of driver performance than models based on 3-D (speed or distance) information. APPLICATION: The DVA model has applications to several traffic safety issues, including automated driving systems and traffic flow models. Language: en","authors":["George J. Andersen","Craig W.

{"abstract":"While much is known about differences in decision making outcomes related to pilot expertise, less is known about the processes that underlie these differences. We explored expertise differences in decision making processes by simultaneously measuring expert and novice pilots' attention, using eye-tracking, and their decision outcomes in a realistic context. We also investigated how expertise differences in pilots' attentional strategies were influenced by cue properties of diagnosticity and correlation. Fourteen expert and 14 novice pilots flew brief simulated flights. Half the flights contained failures that required diagnosis and an action (i.e., a decision). The environmental cues that signaled these failures varied in diagnosticity and\/or correlation. We found that experts made better decisions than novices in terms of speed and accuracy. Both groups made faster correct decisions when cues were higher in diagnosticity. Only experts made faster correct decisions when cues were correlated. Experts attended more to cues relevant to the failure when a failure was present. Findings suggest that expertise differences in decision outcomes partly reflect attentional strategies relevant to problem diagnosis. Language: en","authors":["Angela Schriver","Daniel G.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors used algorithms to estimate driver distraction and predict crash and near-crash risk on the basis of driver glance behavior using the data set of the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study. BACKGROUND: Driver distraction has been a leading cause of motor vehicle crashes, but the relationship between distractions and crash risk lacks detailed quantification. METHOD: The authors compared 24 algorithms that varied according to how they incorporated three potential contributors to distraction--glance duration, glance history, and glance location--on how well the algorithms predicted crash risk. RESULTS: Distraction estimated from driver eye-glance patterns was positively associated with crash risk. The algorithms incorporating ongoing off-road glance duration predicted crash risk better than did the algorithms incorporating glance history. Augmenting glance duration with other elements of glance behavior--1.5th power of duration and duration weighted by glance location--produced similar prediction performance as glance duration alone. CONCLUSIONS: The distraction level estimated by the algorithms that include current glance duration provides the most sensitive indicator of crash risk.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments examined whether prior interaction within an immersive virtual environment (VE) enabled people to improve the accuracy of their distance judgments and whether an improved ability to estimate distance generalized to other means of estimating distances. BACKGROUND: Prior literature has consistently found that users of immersive VEs underestimate distances by approximately 50%. METHOD: In each of the two experiments, 16 participants viewed objects in an immersive VE and estimated their distance to them by means of blindfolded walking tasks before and after interacting with the VE. RESULTS: The interaction task significantly corrected users' underestimation bias to nearly veridical. Differences between pre- and post-interaction mean distance estimation accuracy were large (d = 4.63), and significant (p < .001), and they generalized across response task. CONCLUSION: This finding limits the generality of the underestimation effect in VEs and suggests that distance underestimation in VEs may not be a road block to the development of VE applications.

{"abstract":"This investigation had two main objectives: 1) to assess the comparability of volumes determined by operator-controlled image quantification with automated image analysis in evaluating atrophic brain changes related to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children, and 2) to assess the extent of diffuse structural changes throughout the brain as determined by reduced volume of a brain structure or region of interest (ROI). Operator-controlled methods used ANALYZE(R) software for segmentation and tracing routines of pre-defined brain structures and ROIs. For automated image analyses, the open-access FreeSurfer program was used. Sixteen children with moderate-to-severe TBI were compared to individually matched, typically developing control children and the volumes of 18 brain structures and\/or ROIs were compared between the two methods. Both methods detected atrophic changes but differed in the magnitude of the atrophic effect with the best agreement in subcortical structures. The volumes of all brain structures\/ROIs were smaller in the TBI group regardless of method used; overall effect size differences were minimal for caudate and putamen but moderate to large for all other measures. This is reflective of the diffuse nature of TBI and its widespread impact on structural brain integrity, indicating that both FreeSurfer and operator-controlled methods can reliably assess volumetric changes in pediatric TBI.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare a standardized road test to naturalistic driving by older people who may have cognitive impairment to define improvements that could potentially enhance the validity of road testing in this population. BACKGROUND: Road testing has been widely adapted as a tool to assess driving competence of older people who may be at risk for unsafe driving because of dementia; however, the validity of this approach has not been rigorously evaluated. METHOD: For 2 weeks, 80 older drivers (38 healthy elders and 42 with cognitive impairment) who passed a standardized road test were video recorded in their own vehicles. Using a standardized rating scale, 4 hr of video was rated by a driving instructor. The authors examine weighting of individual road test items to form global impressions and to compare road test and naturalistic driving using factor analyses of these two assessments. RESULTS: The road test score was unidimensional, reflecting a major factor related to awareness of signage and traffic behavior. Naturalistic driving reflected two factors related to lane keeping as well as traffic behavior. CONCLUSION: Maintenance of proper lane is an important dimension of driving safety that appears to be relatively underemphasized during the highly supervised procedures of the standardized road test.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: General aviation (GA) pilot performance utilizing a mixed-modality simulated data link was objectively evaluated based on the time required in accessing, understanding, and executing data link commands. Additional subjective data were gathered on workload, situation awareness (SA), and preference. BACKGROUND: Research exploring mixed-modality data link integration to the single-pilot GA cockpit is lacking, especially with respect to potential effects on safety. METHODS: Sixteen visual flight rules (VFR)-rated pilots participated in an experiment using a flight simulator equipped with a mixed-modality data link. Data link modalities were text display, synthesized speech, digitized speech, and synthesized speech\/text combination. Flight conditions included VFR (unlimited ceiling and visibility) or marginal VFR flight conditions (clouds 2,800 ft above ground level, 3-mile visibility). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in pilot performance, mental workload, and SA across the data link modalities. Textual data link resulted in increased time and workload as compared with the three speech-type data link conditions, which did not differ. SA measures indicated higher performance with textual and digitized speech data link conditions. CONCLUSION: Textual data link can be significantly enhanced for single-pilot GA operations by the addition of a speech component. APPLICATION: Potential applications include operational safety in future GA systems that incorporate data link for use by a single pilot and guidance in the development of flight performance objectives for these systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: These experiments address concerns that motor vehicles in electric engine mode are so quiet that they pose a risk to pedestrians, especially those with visual impairments. BACKGROUND: The \"quiet car\" issue has focused on hybrid and electric vehicles, although it also applies to internal combustion engine vehicles. Previous research has focused on detectability of vehicles, mostly in quiet settings. Instead, we focused on the functional ability to perceive vehicle motion paths. METHOD: Participants judged whether simulated vehicles were traveling straight or turning, with emphasis on the impact of background traffic sound. RESULTS: In quiet, listeners made the straight-or-turn judgment soon enough in the vehicle's path to be useful for deciding whether to start crossing the street. This judgment is based largely on sound level cues rather than the spatial direction of the vehicle. With even moderate background traffic sound, the ability to tell straight from turn paths is severely compromised. The signal-to-noise ratio needed for the straight-or-turn judgment is much higher than that needed to detect a vehicle. CONCLUSION: Although a requirement for a minimum vehicle sound level might enhance detection of vehicles in quiet settings, it is unlikely that this requirement would contribute to pedestrian awareness of vehicle movements in typical traffic settings with many vehicles present. APPLICATION: The findings are relevant to deliberations by government agencies and automobile manufacturers about standards for minimum automobile sounds and, more generally, for solutions to pedestrians' needs for information about traffic, especially for pedestrians with sensory impairments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to better understand the role played by perceptual load, at both central and peripheral regions of the visual scene, in driving safety. BACKGROUND: Attention is a crucial factor in driving safety, and previous laboratory studies suggest that perceptual load is an important factor determining the efficiency of attentional selectivity. Yet, the effects of perceptual load on driving were never studied systematically. METHOD: Using a driving simulator, we orthogonally manipulated the load levels at the road (central load) and its sides (peripheral load), while occasionally introducing critical events at one of these regions. RESULTS: Perceptual load affected driving performance at both regions of the visual scene. Critically, the effect was different for central versus peripheral load: Whereas load levels on the road mainly affected driving speed, load levels on its sides mainly affected the ability to detect critical events initiating from the roadsides. Moreover, higher levels of peripheral load impaired performance but mainly with low levels of central load, replicating findings with simple letter stimuli. CONCLUSION: Perceptual load has a considerable effect on driving, but the nature of this effect depends on the region of the visual scene at which the load is introduced. APPLICATION: Given the observed importance of perceptual load, authors of future studies of driving safety should take it into account. Specifically, these findings suggest that our understanding of factors that may be relevant for driving safety would benefit from studying these factors under different levels of load at different regions of the visual scene.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a robust, real-time system for detecting driver lane changes. Background: As intelligent transportation systems evolve to assist drivers in their intended behaviors, the systems have demonstrated a need for methods of inferring driver intentions and detecting intended maneuvers. METHOD: Using a \"model tracing\" methodology, our system simulates a set of possible driver intentions and their resulting behaviors using a simplification of a previously validated computational model of driver behavior. The system compares the model's simulated behavior with a driver's actual observed behavior and thus continually infers the driver's unobservable intentions from her or his observable actions. RESULTS: For data collected in a driving simulator, the system detects 82% of lane changes within 0.5 s of maneuver onset (assuming a 5% false alarm rate), 93% within 1 s, and 95% before the vehicle moves one fourth of the lane width laterally. For data collected from an instrumented vehicle, the system detects 61% within 0.5 s, 77% within 1 s, and 84% before the vehicle moves one-fourth of the lane width laterally. CONCLUSION: The model-tracing system is the first system to demonstrate high sample-by-sample accuracy at low false alarm rates as well as high accuracy over the course of a lane change with respect to time and lateral movement.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examines how naturalistic driving performance is influenced by the perceived reliability of an in-vehicle warning system using a unique measure of perceived reliability. BACKGROUND: Prior studies of warning reliability conducted in simulator and test-track experiments demonstrate that the objective reliability of a warning can influence a driver's responsiveness to that warning. METHODS: Driver responses to lateral drift warnings (LDWs) were examined to determine if the latency to initiate a corrective steering response was related to the subjective reliability of prior system performance. An operational definition of subjective reliability was developed based on measures of the proportion of LDWs responded to by a steering correction in the preceding 24-hr period - the day proportion. Age, gender, weather condition, light level, road class, weekday status, and day proportion were used to model correction latency in a linear model. RESULTS: A main effect of day proportion was found, suggesting that reaction time to respond decreases by about 375 ms as the day proportion increases from 0 to 1. CONCLUSION: The study illustrates a method of quantifying subjective reliability and performance using naturalistic data. The results suggest that latency to make a steering correction is inversely related to the perceived reliability of the warning system in the 24 hr preceding the warning. APPLICATION: The results have direct application to the method of assessing the efficacy of in-vehicle collision warning systems, suggesting that use of a perceived reliability measure may better predict a driver's disposition to respond to a warning.

{"abstract":"Recent studies showed that active yaw moment control is the most effective method to improve the stability and road handling of vehicles. Corrective yaw moment action should be applied to a vehicle in order to improve the vehicle dynamic performance. The corrective yaw moment is directly related to the interaction between the tires and road, which could either be generated directly or indirectly. Subsequently, the performance of the yaw moment control system, in low-friction road conditions, would noticeably be reduced. An innovative method is proposed to generate the corrective yaw moment by utilizing a momentum wheel that works independent of the tire\/road interaction.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This experiment attempted to identify the features of air traffic geometry that would influence the difficulty and biases of pilots' conflict detection using a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI). BACKGROUND: There was previously no systematic study on effects of such features on conflict detection using the CDTI. METHOD: Twenty-four pilots viewed dynamic encounters between their own aircraft and an intruder aircraft on a simulated CDTI; difficulty was varied by the intruder aircraft's distance and time to closest point of approach (CPA), relative speed, miss distance at CPA, approach side, and conflict angle. Participants estimated the intruder's location at, and its time to, CPA. Effects on three estimation error measures were explored: intruder's miss distance at CPA, orientation at CPA, and time to CPA. RESULTS: (a) Estimation errors increased with slower speeds, longer times to CPA, and longer distances to CPA and with longer miss distances at CPA; (b) the best performance occurred at a conflict angle of 90 degrees; (c) there was a bias to judge conflicts to be more risky than was actually the case; and (d) there was a \"distance-over-speed\" bias, such that two aircraft farther apart and converging rapidly were perceived as less risky than when they were closer to each other and converging at a slower rate, despite identical time to CPA. CONCLUSION: Pilots' conflict detection with CDTI was subject to various errors and biases, which has important safety implications. APPLICATION: The design of procedures, displays, and decision support tools for the free flight environment needs to take these human performance limitations into account.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the human response to motion-cuing algorithms (MCAs) by comparing users' perception to several proposed objective indicators. BACKGROUND: Other researchers have proposed several MCAs, but few improvements have been achieved lately. One of the reasons for this lack of progress is that fair comparisons between different algorithms are hard to achieve, for their evaluation needs to be performed with humans and the tuning process is slow. METHOD: This characterization is performed by means of a comparison of the subjective perception of vehicle simulation users (90 participants) against several proposed objective indicators that try to measure MCA performance. Two motion platforms (3 and 6 degrees of freedom [DoF]) and two vehicle simulators (a driving simulator and a speedboat simulator) were tested using the classical washout algorithm, considered to be the main reference in MCA literature. RESULTS: Results show that users are more sensitive to correlation and delay with respect to the expected motion rather than its magnitude and that specific force is more of a factor than angular speed in the driving simulator. The opposite happens in the speedboat simulator. CONCLUSIONS: Human drivers' reaction to MCA is mainly characterized by the normalized Pearson correlation between output and input signals of the algorithm. This finding validates the main MCA strategy that consists of downscaling the signals and slightly distorting their frequency spectrum. The 6-DoF simulator is perceived as a modest improvement of the 3-DoF platform. APPLICATIONS: These results set the basis for future automatic tuning, evaluation, and comparison of MCA in motion platforms. Language: en","authors":["Sergio Casas","Inmaculada Coma","Jos\u00e9 V.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of hearing loss, aviation headset type, flight workload complexity, and communication signal quality on pilots' performance in an army rotary-wing flight simulator. BACKGROUND: To maintain flight status, army aviators who do not meet current audiometric standards require a hearing loss waiver, which is based on speech intelligibility in quiet conditions. Because hearing loss characteristics of hearing-impaired aviators can vary greatly, and because performance is likely also influenced by degree of flight workload and communication demand, it was expected that performance among hearing-impaired aviators would also vary. METHOD: Participants were 20 army helicopter pilots. Pilots flew three flights in a full motion-based helicopter simulator,with a different headset configuration and varying flight workload levels and communication signal quality characterizing each flight. Objective flight performance parameters of heading, altitude, and airspeed deviation and air traffic control command read-backs were measured. RESULTS: Statistically significant results suggest that high levels of flight workload, especially in combination with poor communications signal quality, lead to deficits in flight performance and speech intelligibility. CONCLUSION: These results support a conclusion that factors other than hearing thresholds and speech intelligibility in quiet should be considered when evaluating helicopter pilots' flight safety. The results also support a recommendation that hearing-impaired pilots use assistive communication technology and not fly with strictly passive headsets. APPLICATION: The combined effects of flight environment with individual hearing levels should be considered when making recommendations concerning continued aviation flight status and those concerning communications headsets used in high-noise cockpits.

{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of cyberbullying experiences among public and private school students in Turkey. One hundred eighty-three participants between the ages of 14 and 15 were recruited for the study. Participants were asked to respond to questionnaires measuring demographic information, usage frequency of Internet-mediated communication tools (IMCT), and cyberbullying experience (as a victim and as a bully). Participants who reported cyberbullying victimization were also asked how they felt and whether they sought help after such experiences. Results indicated that public school students were more likely than private school students to report being cyberbullies and cybervictims despite that private school students were more likely than public school students to report more frequent usage of IMCT. The findings of the logistic regression analyses indicated that usage frequency of IMCT was a significant predictor of cyberbullying\/victimization for public school students but not for private school students. While victims from private school revealed that they did not mind the cyberbullying experience because they thought it was a joke, victims from public school reported that they felt angry when they experienced cyberbullying. Both public and private schools indicated that friends were their first choice for help.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of different driving scenarios (urban, rural, highway) on the timing required by drivers from a two-stage warning system, based on car-to-car communication. BACKGROUND: Car-to-car communication systems are designed to inform drivers of potential hazards at an early stage, before they are visible to them. Here, questions arise as to how drivers acknowledge early warnings and when they should be informed (first stage) and warned (second stage). Hence, optimum timing for presenting the information was tested. METHOD: A psychophysical method was used to establish the optimum timing in three driving scenarios at different speed limits (urban: 50 km\/h, rural: 100 km\/h, highway: 130 km\/h). A total of 24 participants (11 female, 13 male; M = 29.1 years, SD = 11.6 years) participated in the study. RESULTS: The results showed that the optimum timing did not differ among the three scenarios.The first and second stages should ultimately be presented at different timings at each speed limit (first stage: 26.5 s, second stage: 12.1 s before a potential hazard). CONCLUSION: The results showed that well-selected timing for activating information and warning is crucial for the acceptance of these systems. Appropriate timing for presenting the information and warning can be derived for these systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to quantify maximum acceptable torques (MATs) in 16 healthy male industrial workers while performing six motions: screw driving clockwise with a 40 mm handle and a 39 mm yoke handle, flexion and extension with a pinch grip,ulnar deviation with a power grip (similar to knife cutting), and a handgrip task (similar to a pliers task). BACKGROUND: Psychophysical studies on repetitive motions of the wrist and hand were previously reported on women; however, it is not clear how men will psychophysically respond to similar motions. METHOD: A psychophysical methodology was used in which the participant adjusted the resistance on the handle. Repetition rates for these tasks were 15 and 25 per minute. Participants performed the tasks for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week, and for 12 days. Symptoms were recorded by the subjects at the end of each hour. RESULTS: The mean MATs ranged from 1.15 Nm to 1.88 Nm for screw driving, 2.26 Nm to 3.71 Nm for pinch flexion and extension, 3.88 Nm to 4.07 Nm for ulnar deviation, and 11.47 Nm to 13.98 Nm for the handgrip task. The higher the repetition rate, the lower the MAT. Depending on the type of task and repetition rate, these values represented 15% to 35% (median of 23%) of their maximum isometric torque.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research directly tests the relationship between comprehension probability of highway signs and the extent to which they comply with three ergonomic principles of design: sign-content compatibility, familiarity, and standardization. BACKGROUND: A recent study that evaluated comprehension of traffic signs in four different countries showed that comprehension level varies widely and is apparently related to the extent that the sign's design incorporates ergonomic guidelines for good design (D. Shinar, R. E. Dewar, H. Summala, and L. Zakowska 2003). METHOD: Participants were presented with 30 signs and asked to describe each sign's meaning. They then evaluated each sign in terms of each of three ergonomic principles. In addition, a group of human factors\/ergonomics experts evaluated each sign on its standardization and compatibility. RESULTS: There were high correlations between the ratings of the students and the ratings of the experts on compatibility (rho = .94) and on standardization (rho = .84), validating the use of the students' evaluations of the signs on these variables. There was a great variability in signs' comprehension and high and statistically significant correlations between the comprehension level of each sign and the extent to which it complied with compatibility (R = .76), familiarity (R = .89), and standardization (R = .88) principles. CONCLUSIONS: The more signs conform to universal ergonomic principles of good design, the more likely they are to be comprehended by drivers of different cultural backgrounds.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined preferences for different forms of causal explanations for indeterminate situations. BACKGROUND: Klein and Hoffman distinguished several forms of causal explanations for indeterminate, complex situations: single-cause explanations, lists of causes, and explanations that interrelate several causes. What governs our preferences for single-cause (simple) versus multiple- cause (complex) explanations? METHOD: In three experiments, we examined the effect of target audience, explanatory context, participant nationality, and explanation type. All participants were college students. Participants were given two scenarios, one regarding the U.S. economic collapse in 2007 to 2008 and the other about the sudden success of the U.S. military in Iraq in 2007. The participants were asked to assess various types of causal explanations for each of the scenarios, with reference to one or more purposes or audience for the explanations. RESULTS: Participants preferred simple explanations for presentation to less sophisticated audiences. Malaysian students of Chinese ethnicity preferred complex explanations more than did American students. The form of presentation made a difference: Participants preferred complex to simple explanations when given a chance to compare the two, but the preference for simple explanations increased when there was no chance for compari- son, and the difference between Americans and Malaysians disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Preferences for explanation forms can vary with the context and with the audience, and they depend on the nature of the alternatives that are provided.

Performance (errors of omission, errors of commission, and reaction time) was compared before and after the earthquake. RESULTS: Errors of omission increased after the earthquake. Changes in errors of commission and reaction times were, however, dependent on individual differences in stress response to the earthquake.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper's first objective is to determine whether motor priming assistance (consisting of directional steering wheel vibrations) can be of some benefit compared with more traditional auditory (lateralized sound) or vibratory (symmetric steering wheel oscillation) warning devices. We hypothesize that warning devices favor driving situation diagnosis, whereas motor priming can improve the initiation of action even further. Another objective is to assess the possible benefits of using multimodal information by combining auditory warning with simple steering wheel vibration or motor priming. BACKGROUND: Within the context of active safety devices, the experiment dealt with moderately intrusive driving assistance devices that intervene when a certain level of risk in terms of lane departure is reached. METHOD: An analysis of the steering behavior of 20 participants following episodes of visual occlusion was carried out. Five warning and motor priming devices were compared. RESULTS: All tested devices improved the drivers' steering performance, although their effects were modulated by the drivers' risk assessment. However, performance improvements were found to be greater with a motor priming device. No additional performance enhancement was observed when auditory warning was added to steering wheel vibration or motor priming devices. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the hypothesis that the direct intervention of motor priming at the action level is more effective than a simple warning, which intervenes upstream in situation diagnosis. Multimodal information did not seem to improve driver performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study defines display design factors linking visual accommodation and the perceived size of distant objects. BACKGROUND: In 1947, in anticipation of augmented contact and sensor-relayed contact displays, a periscope was installed in an airplane to serve as a sensor-based contact display simulator. To achieve normal landing performance, however, the unity image had to be magnified. This successful intervention, first published in 1966 in Human Factors, implicated oculomotor mechanisms and higher perceptual functions and became the observational basis for a series of investigative hypotheses. METHOD: Observers registered the perceived size of the collimated image of a\"moon\"by adjusting a disk of light while alternatively providing optometric measurements of accommodative distance. RESULTS: Various investigators found high correlations between focal distances and perceived moon sizes. CONCLUSION: The simulated moon provided a superior vehicle for revealing the relationship between focal distance and perceived size and the factors affecting both. The operational display design implications and the possibility of a partial explanation for the moon illusion provided the motivation for an important doctoral research project involving eight factors that affect both focal distance and perceived size. APPLICATION: The investigation reaffirmed that virtual images, as found in head-up and head-mounted displays (HUDs and HMDs, respectively), do not consistently draw focus to optical infinity and that a variety of factors necessarily manipulated by display designers and present in many operational systems can affect visual performance partially through the mediation of accommodation.

Researchers in this field often use the NASATask Load Index (NASA-TLX) as a global measure of workload by aggregating the NASA-TLX's component items. Using this practice, one may overlook the distinction between traits and states.

After every session, individuals completed a modified version of the NASA-TLX that included team workload measures.We then examined the workload items by using a between-subjects and within-subjects perspective. RESULTS: Between-subjects and within-subjects correlations among the items indicated the workload items are more independent within subjects (as states) than between subjects (as traits). Correlations between the workload items and simulation performance were also different at the trait and state levels.

{"abstract":"There is an ongoing debate in the literature whether problematic Internet use (PIU) and problematic online gaming (POG) are two distinct conceptual and nosological entities or whether they are the same. The present study contributes to this question by examining the interrelationship and the overlap between PIU and POG in terms of sex, school achievement, time spent using the Internet and\/or online gaming, psychological well-being, and preferred online activities. Questionnaires assessing these variables were administered to a nationally representative sample of adolescent gamers (N=2,073; Mage=16.4 years, SD=0.87; 68.4% male). Data showed that Internet use was a common activity among adolescents, while online gaming was engaged in by a considerably smaller group. Similarly, more adolescents met the criteria for PIU than for POG, and a small group of adolescents showed symptoms of both problem behaviors. The most notable difference between the two problem behaviors was in terms of sex. POG was much more strongly associated with being male. Self-esteem had low effect sizes on both behaviors, while depressive symptoms were associated with both PIU and POG, affecting PIU slightly more. In terms of preferred online activities, PIU was positively associated with online gaming, online chatting, and social networking, while POG was only associated with online gaming. Based on our findings, POG appears to be a conceptually different behavior from PIU, and therefore the data support the notion that Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder are separate nosological entities.

We investigate whether AR cues improve or interfere with hazard perception in elderly drivers with age-related cognitive decline. METHOD: A total of 20 elderly (M = 73 years, SD = 5) licensed drivers with a range of cognitive abilities measured by a speed-of-processing (SOP) composite participated in a 1-hr drive in an interactive, fixed-base driving simulator. Each participant drove through six straight, 6-mile-long, rural roadway scenarios following a lead vehicle. AR cues directed attention to potential roadside hazards in three of the scenarios, and the other three were uncued (baseline) drives. Effects of AR cuing were evaluated with respect to (a) detection of hazardous target objects, (b) interference with detecting nonhazardous secondary objects, and (c) impairment in maintaining safe distance behind a lead vehicle. RESULTS: AR cuing improved the detection of hazardous target objects of low visibility. AR cues did not interfere with detection of nonhazardous secondary objects and did not impair ability to maintain safe distance behind a lead vehicle (close following). SOP capacity did not moderate those effects. CONCLUSION: AR cues show promise for improving elderly driver safety by increasing hazard detection likelihood without interfering with other driving tasks, such as maintaining safe headway.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess whether a concurrent but independent navigation task exacerbates the effects of hearing loss on speech recognition and whether hearing loss degrades performance of the navigation task during the concurrent but independent listening task. BACKGROUND: Navigation performance and speech comprehension both decrease when a driver follows hard-to-hear concurrent verbal instructions. It remains unknown how much both tasks would be affected when performed concurrently, if tasks were independent. METHOD: Participants performed a listening task by responding to Callsign Acquisition Test (CAT) stimuli at three simulated hearing levels. For each hearing level, one trial was performed with the participant standing still and another trial was performed while navigating a path in a virtual environment using a handheld map. In one more trial, participants navigated a path with no CAT. The proportion of call signs correctly repeated and the total time required to walk the path were measured. RESULTS: CAT scores showed an expected negative effect of hearing loss. Concurrent navigation produced an even larger decrease in CAT score. Hearing loss caused a slight but not significant decrease in navigation task performance. CONCLUSION: A person with hearing loss may communicate less effectively while walking than predicted on the basis of hearing loss alone. The hearing loss, however, does not significantly decrease walking performance in a simple navigation task. APPLICATION: Obtained results may guide soldier performance modeling and requirements for communication systems used during physical activity when a soldier's hearing becomes compromised during dismounted combat operations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: As the world's most dangerous profession, sea fishing enables discussion of the concept of resilience and its articulation to the notion of safety in complex systems. BACKGROUND: In the small, emerging community working on this concept, the prevailing idea to improve safety is that resilience must be reinjected into the know-how of complex systems. METHOD: Thirty-four male skippers, divided into two groups, took part in an interactive simulation of a fishing campaign. They had to make decisions in situations of trade-off between safety and production goals. RESULTS: From the time they left the harbor, the fishermen never gave up on fishing, even in extreme conditions, and regardless of whether or not the catch was good. Not being suicidal, however, they used multiple expert strategies to reduce risk without giving up on their fishing activity. CONCLUSION: Systems run by craftspeople are very resilient because they rely on a high level of adaptability, based on the actors' expertise, linked to an exposure to frequent and considerable risk. Each actor is responsible for his or her own safety. The final discussion bears on the question of knowing whether or not it is possible to design a safe system while preserving its craftsmanship and therefore its native resilience. APPLICATION: The results of these studies suggest potential adverse effects of classic safety interventions in complex sociotechnical systems either in terms of professional reluctance to accept new recommendations or through the emergence of new sources of risk.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt the Crew Resource Management (CRM) Attitudes Questionnaire (CMAQ) to the maritime domain, to assess the ship management attitudes of junior naval officers, and to determine the extent to which these attitudes correlate with behavior and performance in a naval exercise. BACKGROUND: CRM attitudes have been shown to be associated with performance in aviation, but it is unclear whether this construct is applicable and relevant to the maritime domain. METHOD: Participants were 121 active seafarers and 101 junior officers of the German Navy who completed the Ship Management Attitudes Questionnaire-German Navy (SMAQ-GN). Ratings of nontechnical skills and ratings of mission success of the junior officers were collected during a real-world naval exercise. RESULTS: Internal consistencies of SMAQ-GN were similar to those of the original CMAQ and retest reliability was rather high. Attitudes of junior officers toward communication and coordination were positive. Regarding command responsibility and the recognition of stressor effects, positive as well as neutral and negative attitudes were found. Overall, attitudes did not correlate with behavior and performance. Separate analysis of those participants reporting negative to neutral ship management attitudes showed substantial positive correlations of attitudes with behavior and performance. CONCLUSION: Ship management attitudes play a significant role in commanding ships. The attitude-performance linkage is not linear. Behavior and performance are less effective in officers with negative attitudes and equally effective in officers with slightly positive and very positive attitudes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a computational model of the automation complacency effect, as operators work on a robotic arm task, supported by three different degrees of automation. BACKGROUND: Some computational models of complacency in human-automation interaction exist, but those are formed and validated within the context of fairly simplified monitoring failures. This research extends model validation to a much more complex task, so that system designers can establish, without need for human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimentation, merits and shortcomings of different automation degrees. METHOD: We developed a realistic simulation of a space-based robotic arm task that could be carried out with three different levels of trajectory visualization and execution automation support. Using this simulation, we performed HITL testing. Complacency was induced via several trials of correctly performing automation and then was assessed on trials when automation failed. Following a cognitive task analysis of the robotic arm operation, we developed a multicomponent model of the robotic operator and his or her reliance on automation, based in part on visual scanning. RESULTS: The comparison of model predictions with empirical results revealed that the model accurately predicted routine performance and predicted the responses to these failures after complacency developed. However, the scanning models do not account for the entire attention allocation effects of complacency. APPLICATIONS: Complacency modeling can provide a useful tool for predicting the effects of different types of imperfect automation. The results from this research suggest that focus should be given to supporting situation awareness in automation development. Language: en","authors":["Christopher D.

{"abstract":"The objective of the study was to investigate the validity of 3D-accelerometry-based Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score estimation. In particular, acceleration patterns of BBS tasks and gait were targets of analysis. Accelerations of the lower back were measured during execution of the BBS test and corridor-walking for 54 subjects, consisting of neurological patients, older adults, and healthy young persons. The BBS score was estimated from 1-3 BBS tasks and from gait-related data, separately, through assessment of the similarity of acceleration patterns between subjects. The work also validated both approaches' ability to classify subjects into high- and low-fall-risk groups. The gait-based method yielded the best BBS score estimates and the most accurate BBS-task-based estimates were produced with the stand to sit, reaching, and picking object tasks. The proposed gait-based method can identify subjects with high or low risk of falling with an accuracy of 77.8% and 96.6%, respectively, and the BBS-task-based method with corresponding accuracy of 89.5% and 62.1%.

{"abstract":"In a previous study (Lotze et al., 2007) we described dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation in healthy subjects during retaliation in a competitive reaction time task. Interestingly, the less callous the subjects were, the more they responded with ventral mPFC-activation when watching the opponent suffering. In this study we used this paradigm to investigate behavioral and neural responding of ten criminal psychopathic individuals from a forensic psychiatric institution. In contrast to healthy subjects, who show reactive aggressive behavior of inflicting punishment with increasing intensity after experiencing an increasing amount of punishment from a yoked opponent, psychopathic participants did not react with comparable retaliation. However, when psychopaths punished with a high amount they showed increased activation in the hypothalamus, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala. The trait \"physical aggression\" showed a positive correlation with hypothalamic activation. Medial prefrontal areas, associated with emotional control and conflict management in healthy subjects performing this paradigm, were inactive in psychopathic subjects during retaliation. When psychopaths observed the yoked opponent being punished they showed increased activation in the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which was positively associated by impulsivity and antisocial behavior of Hare's psychopathy construct. This finding supports the notion that reactive aggression is more related to antisocial behavior and anger management than with emotional and interpersonal characteristics of psychopathy and suggests that two separate brain activation patterns seem to account for these two behavioral dispositions.

BACKGROUND: Considerable engineering effort has been devoted to developing force augmented reality (AR) systems to assist users in delicate procedures like microsurgery. In contrast, far less has been done to characterize the behavioral outcomes of these systems, and no research has systematically examined the impact of sensory and perceptual processes on force augmentation effectiveness. METHOD: Using a handheld force magnifier as an exemplar haptic AR, we conducted three experiments to characterize its utility in the perception of force and stiffness. Experiments 1 and 2 measured, respectively, the user's ability to detect and differentiate weak force (RESULTS: The user's ability to detect and differentiate small forces was significantly improved by augmentation at both threshold and suprathreshold levels. The augmentation also enhanced stiffness perception. However, although perception of augmented forces matches that of the physical equivalent for weak forces, it falls off with increasing intensity. CONCLUSION: The loss in the effectiveness reflects the nature of sensory and perceptual processing. Such perceptual limitations should be taken into consideration in the design and development of haptic AR systems to maximize utility.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this work, we expand on the theory of adaptive aiding by measuring the effectiveness of coadaptive aiding, wherein we explicitly allow for both system and user to adapt to each other. BACKGROUND: Adaptive aiding driven by psychophysiological monitoring has been demonstrated to be a highly effective means of controlling task allocation and system functioning. Psychophysiological monitoring is uniquely well suited for coadaptation, as malleable brain activity may be used as a continuous input to the adaptive system.

We used interface adaptations and automation that are plausible for real-world operations, presented in the context of a multi-remotely piloted aircraft control simulation. Each participant completed 3 days of testing during 1 week. Performance was assessed via proportion of targets successfully engaged. RESULTS: In the first 2 days of testing, there were no significant differences in performance between the conditions. However, in the third session, physiological adaptation produced the highest performance.

{"abstract":"Accessibility is a concept that has become central to physical planning and spatial modelling for more than fifty years. As measure of the relative nearness or proximity of one place and persons to all other places or persons, conceptually linked to Newton's law of gravity, its origins can be traced back to the 1920s when it was used in location theory and regional economic planning (Batty, 2009) and retail planning (Stewart, 1948). In his classic paper, Hansen (1959) was the first to define accessibility as a potential of opportunities for interaction and applied the concept to forecast employment developments in Washington D.C. Hansen's gravity-based measure of accessibility was a generalization of the concept of population potential, which was based on the notion of potential in physics systems by Stewart (1948). Since then, accessibility analyses have addressed the issue of spatial interaction. Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) provide an explicit link between accessibility modelling, and economic, demographic and transport flows. SIMs have a long history and have been used in a wide variety of contexts. Wilson (1970) gave SIMs theoretical strength by deriving them using the entropy maximization approach, and the doubly-constrained form formed the bases for transport flow modelling. The formal equivalence between SIMs and logit models\/micro-economic theory was shown by Anas (1983). The accessibility function can be directly derived from SIMs and it therefore contains SIM behavioural cost components ( Reggiani, 2014). Moreover, the relevance of topological\/connectivity structures in the accessibility analyses has, in some way, been anticipated by Weibull (1980), who considered accessibility as a property of configuration of opportunities for spatial interaction. Accessibility models have in the past decades been applied in several academic fields such as urban geography, rural geography, health geography, time geography, spatial economics and transport engineering. Many different applications have been developed in these fields and can be categorized in several ways. Here, we use the categorization of accessibility measures from the well-cited review paper from Geurs and Van Wee (2004). They provide an overview of components of accessibility and perspectives on accessibility, which we will use as a categorization of accessibility measures. Geurs and Van Wee distinguish four basic perspectives on accessibility: (i) infrastructure-based measures, analyzing the performance or service level of transport infrastructure, (ii) location-based measures, analyzing accessibility of spatially distributed activities, typically on an aggregate level, (iii) person-based measures, founded in the space-time geography, analyzing accessibility at the level of the individual level, and (iv) utility-based measures, analyzing the welfare benefits that people derive from levels of access to the spatially distributed activities. These perspectives focus on one or several of the four components of accessibility distinguished by Geurs and Van Wee: (i) the land-use component reflecting the amount, quality and spatial distribution of opportunities, (ii) the transportation component describing the disutility of travel in terms of time, cost and effort, (iii) the temporal component reflecting the temporal constraints and variability, and (iv) the individual component reflecting the needs, and abilities of individuals. Here, we describe the directions which academic literature in the recent years took to improve the treatment of the four components in accessibility modelling....

Secondly, it was planned to model and formulate the effects of some drugs on cardiac tissues levels of NO, MDA and glutathione in acute organophosphate poisoning in rats by the application of neural network based on experimental results. It has been planned to determine whether artificial neural network (ANN) is appropriate tool to analyze and formulate it. As a result, it has been considered that ANN can be effectively used to model NO, MDA and glutathione level. The performances of ANN formulation versus target experimental values are found to be quite high.

{"abstract":"Studies of risky decision-making have demonstrated that humans typically prefer risky options after incurring a financial loss, while generally preferring safer options after a monetary gain. Here, we examined the neural processes underlying these inconsistent risk preferences by investigating the evaluation of gains and losses, and demonstrating how these responses can impact subsequent preference for either risky or safe choice options. Participants performed a task while undergoing fMRI in which they experienced both gains and losses. Immediately following a gain or loss, participants decided to either play or pass on a \"double-or-quits\" gamble. The outcome of the gamble could either double or eliminate their initial gain (from the time-estimation task) or redeem or double their initial loss. If they chose not to play this gamble, they retained the initial gain or loss. We demonstrate a shift in risk-taking preferences for identical sets of gambles as a function of previous gains or losses, with participants showing a greater preference towards riskier decisions in the context of a prior loss. An interaction between evaluating gain\/loss contexts and subsequent behavioral risk pattern revealed an increased BOLD response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with stronger responses for both gambling in a loss context and safety in a gain context. This suggests that the vmPFC is responsible for integrating these contextual effects, with these processes impacting on subsequent risky choice. Language: en","authors":["Annabel B.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the influence of ongoing task display\"compellingness\"on attention allocation patterns and assessed its interaction with interrupting task salience and importance. BACKGROUND: There are some concerns that the compellingness of flight deck tunnel displays renders the task they support more resistant to interruptions, thus preventing the pilot from noticing cues signaling the need to divert attention to other tasks. METHODS: Forty pilots flew three curved approaches in a high-fidelity simulation using a synthetic vision system (SVS) display. In addition to the primary task of flying, during the last approach they were required to select the approach path on the basis of environmental information concerning weather. The display layout supporting the primary flight task (tunnel vs. baseline display), the nature of the cue signaling the need to divert attention to the path selection task (visual vs. auditory-visual cue), and the cost of not performing the secondary task were manipulated to investigate their influence on task prioritization. RESULTS: The modality and priority of the cue affected the frequency of the switch to the secondary task. Furthermore, pilots flying with a tunnel display were more likely to detect the change in the weather and were easily interrupted by the secondary task when priority was high.

{"abstract":"The cerebellum is thought to be engaged not only in motor control, but also in the neural network dedicated to visual processing of body motion. However, the pattern of connectivity within this network, in particular, between the cortical circuitry for observation of others' actions and the cerebellum remains largely unknown. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity analysis and dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we assessed cerebro-cerebellar connectivity during a visual perceptual task with point-light displays depicting human locomotion. In the left lateral cerebellum, regions in the lobules Crus I and VIIB exhibited increased fMRI response to biological motion. The outcome of the connectivity analyses delivered the first evidence for reciprocal communication between the left lateral cerebellum and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Through communication with the right posterior STS that is as a key node not only for biological motion perception but also for social interaction and visual tasks on theory of mind, the left cerebellum might be involved in a wide range of social cognitive functions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In a simulated combat vehicle, uni-, bi-, and trimodal cueing of direction to threat were compared with the purpose to investigate whether multisensory redundant information may enhance dynamic perception and performance. BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that multimodal display presentation can enhance perception of information and task performance. METHOD: Two experiments in a simulated combat vehicle were performed under the instructions to turn the vehicle toward the threat as fast and accurately as possible after threat cue onset. In Experiment 1, direction to threat was presented by four display types: visual head-down display, tactile belt, 3-D audio, and trimodal with the three displays combined. In Experiment 2, direction to threat was presented by three display types: visual head-up display (HUD)-3-D audio, tactile belt-3-D audio, and trimodal with HUD, tactile belt, and 3-D audio combined. RESULTS: In Experiment I,the trimodal display provided overall best performance and perception of threat direction. In Experiment 2, both the trimodal and HUD--3-D audio displays led to overall best performance, and the trimodal display provided overall the best perception of threat direction. None of the trimodal displays induced higher mental workload or secondary task interference. CONCLUSION: The trimodal displays provided overall enhanced perception and performance in the dynamically framed threat scenario and did not entail higher mental workload or decreased spare capacity. APPLICATION: Trimodal displays with redundant information may contribute to safer and more reliable peak performance in time-critical dynamic tasks and especially in more extreme and stressful situations with high perceptual or mental workload.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effectiveness of a theoretically motivated intervention at reducing procedural errors in train yard operations, where making these errors could be costly or life-threatening. BACKGROUND: A widespread and persistent memory error that people commit on a daily basis is the postcompletion error (PCE), that is, forgetting to complete the final step of a procedural task in which the final step occurs after completion of the task goal. PCEs occur in the railroad industry when a locomotive conductor changes the direction of a rail switch but fails to report this change. This particular error could contribute to unsafe conditions as another train traveling on the same track could derail. Although training can help reduce some of the factors leading to unsafe conditions on the rail, research has demonstrated that PCEs are different from other errors of omission in that they cannot be eliminated through training, which makes them a difficult problem to address. METHOD: Twenty-eight undergraduates completed train yard tasks within a mid-fidelity simulator used in commercial rail operations for training. Each participant received the behavioral intervention in one block and no intervention in another. Specifically, participants were required to perform an additional task designed to remind participants of the postcompletion step. RESULTS: Our intervention significantly reduced PCE rates in the context of train yard operations, on average by 65%. CONCLUSION: We discuss implications of the effectiveness of our intervention at reducing train yard accidents and how this outcome can contribute to the literature on the cause of PCEs. APPLICATION: In cases such as the railroad industry, where redesigning technology is prohibitive, our behavioral intervention is an effective alternative for significantly reducing PCEs.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the low visibility of motorcycles is the result of their low cognitive conspicuity and\/or their low sensory conspicuity for car drivers. BACKGROUND: In several cases of collision between a car and a motorcycle, the car driver failed to detect the motorcyclist in time to avoid the collision. METHOD: To test the low cognitive conspicuity hypothesis, 42 car drivers (32.02 years old) including 21 motorcyclist motorists and 21 non-motorcyclist motorists carried out a motorcycle detection task in a car-driving simulator.To test the low sensory conspicuity hypothesis, the authors studied the effect of the color contrast between motorcycles and the road surface on the ability of car drivers to detect motorcycles when they appear from different parts of the road. RESULTS: A high level of color contrast enhanced the visibility of motorcycles when they appeared in front of the participants. Moreover, when motorcyclists appeared from behind the participants,the motorcyclist motorists detected oncoming motorcycles at a greater distance than did the non-motorcyclist motorists. Motorcyclist motorists carry out more saccades and rapidly capture information (on their rearview mirrors and on the road in front of them). CONCLUSION: The results related to the sensory conspicuity and cognitive conspicuity of motorcycles for car drivers are discussed from the viewpoint of visual attention theories. APPLICATION: The practical implications of these results and future lines of research related to training methods for car drivers are considered.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to examine the utility of a self-report tool that was designed as a partial substitute for a face-to-face cognitive interview for critical incidents involving night vision goggles (NVGs). BACKGROUND: The use of NVGs remains problematic within the military environment, as these devices have been identified as a factor in a significant proportion of aircraft accidents and incidents. The self-report tool was structured to identify some of the cognitive features of human performance that were associated with critical incidents involving NVGs. The tool incorporated a number of different levels of analysis, ranging from specific behavioral responses to broader cognitive constructs. METHOD: Reports were received from 30 active pilots within the Australian Army using the NVG Critical Incident Assessment Tool (NVGCIAT). RESULTS: The results revealed a correspondence between specific types of NVG-related errors and elements of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). In addition, uncertainty emerged as a significant factor associated with the critical incidents that were recalled by operators. CONCLUSION: These results were broadly consistent with previous research and provide some support for the utility of subjective assessment tools as a means of extracting critical incident-related data when face-to-face cognitive interviews are not possible. APPLICATION: In some circumstances, the NVGCIAT might be regarded as a substitute cognitive interview protocol with some level of diagnosticity. Language: en","authors":["Peter F. Renshaw","Mark W.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective is to demonstrate how the Human View architecture can be used to define and evaluate the human interoperability capabilities of a net-centric system. Human interoperability strives to understand the types of system relationships that affect collaboration across networked environments. BACKGROUND: The Human View was developed as an additional system architectural viewpoint to focus on the human component of a system by capturing data on human roles, tasks, constraints, interactions, and metrics.This framework can be used to collect and organize social system parameters to facilitate the way that humans interact across organizational boundaries. METHOD: By mapping the Human View elements to organizational relationships defined in the domain of network theory, a network model of the Human View can be developed.This representation can then be aligned with a Layers of Interoperability model for collaborative systems.The model extends traditional technical interoperability to include organizational aspects important for human interoperability. The resulting composite model can be used to evaluate the human interoperability capability of network-enabled systems. RESULTS: An interagency response to a crisis situation is an example where increased levels of human interoperability can affect the effectiveness of the organizational interactions. The existing Human View products representing the interagency capabilities were evaluated using the network model to demonstrate how the social system variables can be identified and evaluated to improve the system design. CONCLUSION: By understanding and incorporating human interoperability requirements, the resulting system design can more effectively support collaborative tasks across technological environments to facilitate timely responses to events.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evaluation was to evaluate the causes and costs of slips, trips, and falls (STFs) in a helicopter manufacturing plant. BACKGROUND: STFs are a significant portion of the total industry injury burden. METHOD: For this study, 4,070 helicopter plant workers who were employed from January 1, 2004, through February 28, 2008, were enrolled. Company records on workers' compensation claims, occupational health first report of injury, and payroll records on hours worked were collected. Cause and source of all injuries, including STFs, were coded for analysis. RESULTS: During the 4-year study period, there were 2,378 injuries and 226 STFs (46 falls [20%] to a lower level, 117 [52%] falls on the same level, 41 [18%] from loss of balance without a fall, and 22 [10%] from other events). Of the 226 STFs, 123 falls to the same level were caused by slippery substances (52), objects on floor (43), and surface hazards (28), and they cost $1,543,946. Falls to lower levels primarily involved access to stands to and from aircraft and falling off large machines. CONCLUSION: More than half of the STF injury claims likely could have been prevented by housekeeping and maintenance, and this cost saving could reasonably offset a considerable portion of the cost of prevention. Training and stand modifications could be considered to prevent falls from elevation from stands, machines, and aircraft. APPLICATION: Recommendations for STF prevention are discussed.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: It was proposed that misuse and disuse often occur because operators (a) cannot determine if automation or a nonautomated alternative maximizes the likelihood of task success (appraisal errors) or (b) know the utilities of the options but disregard this information when deciding to use automation (intent errors). OBJECTIVE: This investigation assessed the effectiveness of performance feedback, a procedure developed to attenuate appraisal errors, and scenario training, an intervention designed to decrease intent errors. METHODS: Operators given feedback were told how many errors they and an automated device made on a target detection task. Scenario training took operators through the thought processes of optimal decision makers after the utilities of the automated and nonautomated alternatives had been determined. Following 200 training trials, participants chose between relying on their observations or an automated device. RESULTS: There was little misuse, but disuse rates were high (84%) among operators receiving neither feedback nor scenario training. Operators paired with a more accurate machine and given feedback made approximately twice as many errors as the automated device. Nevertheless, intent errors were commonplace; 55% of the operators who received feedback without scenario training did not rely on automation. Feedback effectiveness was enhanced when used in conjunction with scenario training; the disuse rate decreased to 29%. CONCLUSION: A combination of feedback and scenario training was more effective in mitigating disuse than either intervention used in isolation. APPLICATION: An important application of these findings is that operator training programs should incorporate techniques to control intent and appraisal errors. Language: en","authors":["Hall P.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypotheses that (a) participants might develop motion sickness while playing \"off-the-shelf\" console video games and (b) postural motion would differ between sick and well participants, prior to the onset of motion sickness. BACKGROUND: There have been many anecdotal reports of motion sickness among people who play console video games (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation). METHOD: Participants (40 undergraduate students) played a game continuously for up to 50 min while standing or sitting. We varied the distance to the display screen (and, consequently, the visual angle of the display). RESULTS: Across conditions, the incidence of motion sickness ranged from 42% to 56%; incidence did not differ across conditions. During game play, head and torso motion differed between sick and well participants prior to the onset of subjective symptoms of motion sickness. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that console video games carry a significant risk of motion sickness.

{"abstract":"The effect of recent experience on current behavior has been studied extensively in simple laboratory tasks. We explore the nature of sequential effects in the more naturalistic setting of automobile driving. Driving is a safety-critical task in which delayed response times may have severe consequences. Using a realistic driving simulator, we find significant sequential effects in pedal-press response times that depend on the history of recent stimuli and responses. Response times are slowed up to 100 ms in particular cases, a delay that has dangerous practical consequences. Further, we observe a significant number of history-related pedal misapplications, which have recently been noted as a cause for concern in the automotive safety community. By anticipating these consequences of sequential context, driver assistance systems could mitigate the effects of performance degradations and thus critically improve driver safety.

{"abstract":"This paper describes recent progress on Crosswatch, a smartphone-based computer vision system developed by the authors for providing guidance to blind and visually impaired pedestrians at traffic intersections. One of Crosswatch's key capabilities is determining the user's location (with precision much better than what is obtainable by GPS) and orientation relative to the crosswalk markings in the intersection that he\/she is currently standing at; this capability will be used to help him\/her find important features in the intersection, such as walk lights, pushbuttons and crosswalks, and achieve proper alignment to these features. We report on two new contributions to Crosswatch: (a) experiments with a modified user interface, tested by blind volunteer participants, that makes it easier to acquire intersection images than with previous versions of Crosswatch; and (b) a demonstration of the system's ability to localize the user with precision better than what is obtainable by GPS, as well as an example of its ability to estimate the user's orientation.
