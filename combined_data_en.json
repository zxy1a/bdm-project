{"abstract":"Prison inmates are exposed to a variety of major risk factors (psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts, illicit drug use). From 1986 to 1996, the USA prison population more than doubled while in France, it increased from 35655 in 1980 to 51623 in 1995. In spite of these findings, very little information concerning the inmates population is available. At the present time, there is a desire to adopt a policy based on the prevention of recidivism, on adequate release planning and referrals to community-based services. The aim of the RAPPEL project was to build an information system for assessing the social and health status of prison inmates. The pilot project was set up at the prison of Loos and allowed the collection and analysis of nearly 15000 records. The aim of this paper is to present the extension of the project consisting in developing a regional network grouping 11 jails. Information locally available will serve as the basis for the information system of regional jails. Data mining techniques will provide solutions for the extraction of new information. Three data mining tools were experimented : association rules, classification trees and clustering. Further extension consists in a distributed approach allowing direct access to the information system by WEB tools. Language: en","authors":["Alain Duhamel","Monique Picavet","Patrick Devos","R.

{"abstract":"Complications during treatment of seriously injured trauma patients cause an increase in mortality rates, and increased treatment costs, including bed occupancy. Current methods treat those at risk, and include numbers of false positives. By finding a method to predict those at risk of the three most common recorded Trauma Registry complications, considerable savings in mortality and treatment costs could arise. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) work well with classification problems using feed-forward\/back propagation methodology. Using the National Trauma Data Bank (V6.2) data files, Tiberius Software created the ANN models. Best models were identified by their Gini co-efficient, ability to predict the complication outcome selected, and their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores. The model ensemble for the three major complications recorded in the registry were determined, variables ranked and model accuracy recorded. The basic ANN is fairly accurate for those likely to contract Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) though with a high rate of false positives. The ANN ability to predict Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is less effective, though better at producing fewer false positives. Predicting Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) cases is not good enough using these input variables. Both VAP and UTI relate to those aged over 55 years, while ARDS related more to those under 16 years. The models need improving.

Among these is \"Gewaltlos Starksein\" (\"Being strong without violence\"), a project of Hauptschule Sophienstrase Braunschweig, Germany (a general education secondary school for grades 5-10). This study aims to discover possible increases in activity through \"Gewaltlos Starksein\" where health-enabling technologies play a major role. A prospective intervention study with a span of 1.5 years was designed to measure this increase in activity. Partners in this study were Hauptschule Sophienstrase as the intervention group and Grund- und Hauptschule Pestalozzistrase as control group. Data collection was performed using a multi-sensor device, and questionnaires. Confirmatory data analysis of average metabolic equivalent (METs) yielded no significant results. Exploratory analysis showed interesting results, especially concerning the number of steps during leisure time. Descriptive analysis of questionnaires showed that all children enjoy physical activity. There were differences in sports team participation, open-air games and club affiliation. The study could not prove that the intervention \"Gewaltlos Starksein\" improves physical activity in children. However, the increased leisure activity step count indicates that \"Gewaltlos Starksein\" has positive effects on children's behaviour. This should be investigated in a further study in cooperation with psychologists.

The Bush administration's leadership in advocating for biosurveillance systems capable of monitoring for bioterrorism attacks suggests that we should move quickly to establish a nationwide early warning biosurveillance system as a defense against this threat. The spirit of collaboration and unity inspired by the events of 9-11 and the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City provided the opportunity to demonstrate how a prototypic biosurveillance system could be rapidly deployed.

{"abstract":"In mass casualty events Emergency Medical Service Providers (EMS) choose treatment at Scene or a \"scoop and run\" approach. The latter requires clinically trained personnel at the reception site to triage patients. Current methodology based on Revised Trauma Score (tRTS) requires use of Glasgow Coma Scale, a method reliant on experience and clinical knowledge. This makes the system subjective and often inadequate for non-clinicians. This project attempts to develop a simplified outcome prediction score using an artificial neural network for use by a non-clinically trained EMS to aid triage. The project uses National Trauma Data Bank, Version 6.1. Tiberius Data Mining Software created Neural Network models. Variables considered were values that could easily be obtained during an event. Binary values were used for low SBP and low Respiratory Rate, coded using the RTS scoring table as a basis, and age indicators. A modified motor component of Glasgow Coma Score was created to negate the need for clinical knowledge. Best performing models, identified by Gini coefficient and ability to predict mortality, were with 8 and 10 neurons. On mortality prediction all even numbers of hidden neurons have similar performances. Training sets were compared to test sets, and found to be identical in Gini coefficient and performance. Models performed well in predicting mortality compared to standard outcome predictors. Possible additional variables such as gender or ethnicity might improve the Neural Network predictive ability.

Technological progress allows for unobtrusive physical activity measurement with miniature sensors, e.g. accelerometers. Yet it is unclear which activities or activity patterns are associated with an increased fall risk. The aim of the research for this paper is to identify daily physical activities associated with a high fall risk. A one-year follow-up study was conducted with n=50 geriatric patients who took part in a telephone interview to assess fall events, their consequences and a set of daily physical activities. Descriptive analysis of the data shows that there are marked differences between fallers (n=21) and non-fallers (n=29) in the overall activity level, the amount of shopping activity and associated locomotion, and in the intensity of light household work. The results confirm that there are differences in typical daily activities between fallers and non-fallers that may be used as parameters to enhance fall prediction models.

However, if an epidemic can be detected and characterized early on, prompt public health intervention may mitigate its impact. Current surveillance approaches do not perform well in terms of rapid epidemic detection or epidemic monitoring.

{"abstract":"As information systems become increasingly integrated with health care delivery, vast amounts of clinical data are stored. Knowledge discovery and data mining methods are potentially powerful for the induction of knowledge models from this data relevant to nursing outcomes. However, an important barrier to the widespread application of these methods for induction of nursing knowledge models is that important concepts relevant to nursing outcomes are often unrepresented in clinical data. For instance, communication approaches are not necessarily consciously chosen by nurses, yet they are known to impact multiple clinical outcomes including satisfaction, pain and symptom response, recovery, physiological change (e.g., blood pressure), and adherence. Decisions about communication behaviors are likely intuitive and instantaneously made in response to cues offered by the patient. For this reason, among others, important choices and actions of nurses are not routinely documented. And so for many clinical outcomes relevant to nursing, important concepts such as communication are not represented in clinical data repositories. In studying poison control center outcomes, it is important to consider not only routinely documented clinical data, but the communication processes and verbal cues of both patient and SPI. In a novel approach, our current study of poison control center outcomes pairs a qualitative study of the communication patterns of SPIs and callers to a regional poison control center, with predictive modeling of poison control center outcomes using knowledge discovery and data mining methods. This three year study, currently in progress, pairs SPI-caller communication analysis with predictive models resulting from the application of knowledge discovery and data mining methods to three years' of archived clinical data. The results will form a hybrid model and the basis for future decision support interventions that leverage knowledge about both implicit and explicit factors that contribute to poison control center outcomes.

{"abstract":"Previous studies have examined the neural correlates of proactive control using a variety of behavioral paradigms; however, the neural network relating the control process to its behavioral consequence remains unclear. Here, we applied a dynamic Bayesian model to a large fMRI data set of the stop signal task to address this issue. By estimating the probability of the stop signal - p(Stop) - trial by trial, we showed that higher p(Stop) is associated with prolonged go trial reaction time (RT), indicating proactive control of motor response. In modeling fMRI signals at trial and target onsets, we distinguished activities of proactive control, prediction error, and RT slowing. We showed that the anterior pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) responds specifically to increased stop signal likelihood, and its activity is correlated with activations of the posterior pre-SMA and bilateral anterior insula during prolonged response times. This directional link is also supported by Granger causality analysis. Furthermore, proactive control, prediction error, and time-on-task are each mapped to distinct areas in the medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings dissect regional functions of the medial prefrontal cortex in cognitive control and provide systems level evidence associating conflict anticipation to its motor consequence.

{"abstract":"A multi-armed bandit problem is a search problem on which a learning agent must select the optimal arm among multiple slot machines generating random rewards. UCB algorithm is one of the most popular methods to solve multi-armed bandit problems. It achieves logarithmic regret performance by coordinating balance between exploration and exploitation. Since UCB algorithms, researchers have empirically known that optimistic value functions exhibit good performance in multi-armed bandit problems. The terms optimistic or optimism might suggest that the value function is sufficiently larger than the sample mean of rewards. The first definition of UCB algorithm is focused on the optimization of regret, and it is not directly based on the optimism of a value function. We need to think the reason why the optimism derives good performance in multi-armed bandit problems. In the present article, we propose a new method, which is called Overtaking method, to solve multi-armed bandit problems. The value function of the proposed method is defined as an upper bound of a confidence interval with respect to an estimator of expected value of reward: the value function asymptotically approaches to the expected value of reward from the upper bound. If the value function is larger than the expected value under the asymptote, then the learning agent is almost sure to be able to obtain the optimal arm. This structure is called sand-sifter mechanism, which has no regrowth of value function of suboptimal arms. It means that the learning agent can play only the current best arm in each time step. Consequently the proposed method achieves high accuracy rate and low regret and some value functions of it can outperform UCB algorithms. This study suggests the advantage of optimism of agents in uncertain environment by one of the simplest frameworks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use a theoretical model (bench) for human factors and ergonomics (HFE) and a comparison with occupational slips, trips, and falls (STFs) risk management to discuss patient STF interventions (bedside). BACKGROUND: Risk factors for patient STFs have been identified and reported since the 1950s and are mostly unchanged in the 2010s. The prevailing clinical view has been that STF events indicate underlying frailty or illness, and so many of the interventions over the past 60 years have focused on assessing and treating physiological factors (dizziness, illness, vision\/hearing, medicines) rather than designing interventions to reduce risk factors at the time of the STF. METHOD: Three case studies are used to discuss how HFE has been, or could be, applied to STF risk management as (a) a design-based (building) approach to embed safety into the built environment, (b) a staff- (and organization-) based approach, and (c) a patient behavior-based approach to explore and understand patient perspectives of STF events. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results from the case studies suggest taking a similar HFE integration approach to other industries, that is, a sustainable design intervention for the person who experiences the STF event-the patient. APPLICATION: This paper offers a proactive problem-solving approach to reduce STFs by patients in acute hospitals. Authors of the three case studies use HFE principles (bench\/book) to understand the complex systems for facility and equipment design and include the perspective of all stakeholders (bedside).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the importance of platform motion to the transfer of performance in motion simulators. BACKGROUND: The importance of platform motion in simulators for pilot training is strongly debated. We hypothesized that the type of motion (e.g., disturbance) contributes significantly to performance differences. METHODS: Participants used a joystick to perform a target tracking task in a pod on top of a MOOG Stewart motion platform. Five conditions compared training without motion, with correlated motion, with disturbance motion, with disturbance motion isolated to the visual display, and with both correlated and disturbance motion. The test condition involved the full motion model with both correlated and disturbance motion. We analyzed speed and accuracy across training and test as well as strategic differences in joystick control. RESULTS: Training with disturbance cues produced critical behavioral differences compared to training without disturbance; motion itself was less important. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of disturbance cues is a potentially important source of variance between studies that do or do not show a benefit of motion platforms in the transfer of performance in simulators.

{"abstract":"Recent evidence has sparked debate about the neural bases of response selection and inhibition. In the current study, we employed two reactive inhibition tasks, the Go\/Nogo (GnG) and Simon tasks, to examine questions central to these debates. First, we investigated whether a fronto-cortical-striatal system was sensitive to the need for inhibition per se or the presentation of infrequent stimuli, by manipulating the proportion of trials that do not require inhibition (Go\/Compatible trials) relative to trials that require inhibition (Nogo\/Incompatible trials). A cortico-subcortical network composed of insula, putamen, and thalamus showed greater activation on salient and infrequent events, regardless of the need for inhibition. Thus, consistent with recent findings, key parts of the fronto-cortical-striatal system are engaged by salient events and do not appear to play a selective role in response inhibition. Second, we examined how the fronto-cortical-striatal system is modulated by working memory demands by varying the number of stimulus-response (SR) mappings. Right inferior parietal lobule showed decreasing activation as the number of SR mappings increased, suggesting that a form of associative memory - rather than working memory - might underlie performance in these tasks. A broad motor planning and control network showed similar trends that were also modulated by the number of motor responses required in each task. Finally, bilateral lingual gyri were more robustly engaged in the Simon task, consistent with the role of this area in shifts of visuo-spatial attention. The current study sheds light on how the fronto-cortical-striatal network is selectively engaged in reactive control tasks and how control is modulated by manipulations of attention and memory load.

{"abstract":"The paper presents the automatic computer-aided balance assessment system for supporting and monitoring the diagnosis and rehabilitation process of patients with limited mobility or disabled in home environment. The system has adopted seven Berg Balance Scale activities. The assessment approach is based on the accelerometric signals acquired by the inertial sensors worn by the patient. Several specific, mostly medium frequency features of signals are introduced and discussed. The reduction of the feature vector has been performed using the multilevel Fisher's linear discriminant. The classification employs the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. The direct assessment effectiveness ranges from 75% to 94% for various activities.

{"abstract":"After continuous and prolonged cognitive workload, people typically show reduced behavioral performance and increased feelings of fatigue, which are known as \"time-on-task (TOT) effects\". Although TOT effects are pervasive in modern life, their underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we induced TOT effects by administering a 20-min continuous psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) to a group of 16 healthy adults and used resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine spontaneous brain activity changes associated with fatigue and performance. Behaviorally, subjects displayed robust TOT effects, as reflected by increasingly slower reaction times as the test progressed and higher self-reported mental fatigue ratings after the 20-min PVT. Compared to pre-test measurements, subjects exhibited reduced amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the default mode network (DMN) and increased ALFF in the thalamus after the test. Subjects also exhibited reduced anti-correlations between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right middle prefrontal cortex after the test. Moreover, pre-test resting ALFF in the PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (MePFC) predicted subjects' subsequent performance decline; individuals with higher ALFF in these regions exhibited more stable reaction times throughout the 20-min PVT. These results support the important role of both task-positive and task-negative networks in mediating TOT effects and suggest that spontaneous activity measured by resting-state BOLD fMRI may be a marker of mental fatigue.

{"abstract":"Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for testifying conventional social theories quantitatively and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden \"ambivalent users\" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights and at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear \"negative to positive\" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self-regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its basis from the traditional emotion management theories in sociology but makes an important extension to the online environment in this study. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.

{"abstract":"Suicide has been a major cause of death throughout the world. Recent studies have proved a reliable connection between the emotional traits and suicide. However, detection and prevention of suicide are mostly carried out in the clinical centers, which limits the effective treatments to a restricted group of people. To assist detecting suicide risks among the public, we propose a novel method by exploring the accumulated emotional information from people's daily writings (i.e. Blogs), and examining these emotional traits which are predictive of suicidal behaviors. A complex emotion topic (CET) model is employed to detect the underlying emotions and emotion-related topics in the Blog streams, based on eight basic emotion categories and five levels of emotion intensities. Since suicide is caused through an accumulative process, we propose three accumulative emotional traits, i.e., accumulation, covariance, and transition of the consecutive Blog emotions, and employ a generalized linear regression algorithm to examine the relationship between emotional traits and suicide risk. Our experiment results suggest that the emotion transition trait turns to be more discriminative of the suicide risk, and that the combination of three traits in linear regression would generate even more discriminative predictions. A classification of the suicide and non-suicide Blog articles in our additional experiment verifies this result. Finally, we conduct a case study of the most commonly mentioned emotion-related topics in the suicidal Blogs, to further understand the association between emotions and thoughts for these authors.

{"abstract":"In this paper, we address issues raised by Tierney and Hart (Assessing Complex Cognitive Functioning Requires Multiple Tasks) in response to our recently published findings showing that less advantageous decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was associated with enhanced right ventral striatal dopamine response to intravenous amphetamine (Oswald et al., 2015). We agree with the overall premise of the paper, which was that decision-making involves multiple components, which may not be tapped by a single measure. While Tierney and Hart also bring up some important issues related to the construct validity of the IGT, we suggest that they are failing to put the findings within the context of the growing body of research that has highlighted the role of DA function in risk-taking behavior across species using a variety of tasks. It should also be noted that it was not our goal to \"cover all bases\" within the context of a single study. Nevertheless, we appreciate the discussion, which we believe highlights the need for further empirical refinement of the construct to facilitate detection and understanding of the differential role that specific molecular mechanisms may play in the component processes.

{"abstract":"The convergence of computing, sensing, and communication technology will soon permit large-scale deployment of self-driving vehicles. This will in turn permit a radical transformation of traffic control technology. This paper makes a case for the importance of addressing questions of social justice in this transformation, and sketches a preliminary framework for doing so. We explain how new forms of traffic control technology have potential implications for several dimensions of social justice, including safety, sustainability, privacy, efficiency, and equal access. Our central focus is on efficiency and equal access as desiderata for traffic control design. We explain the limitations of conventional traffic control in meeting these desiderata, and sketch a preliminary vision for a next-generation traffic control tailored to address better the demands of social justice. One component of this vision is cooperative, hierarchically distributed self-organization among vehicles. Another component of this vision is a priority system enabling selection of priority levels by the user for each vehicle trip in the network, based on the supporting structure of non-monetary credits.

{"abstract":"This study assessed marijuana-related content posted by adolescents on Twitter and examined content variation before and after the 2012 U.S. election legalizing recreational use in two states. For two 3-week periods occurring 6 months before and after the election, a 1% random sample was obtained of all tweets matching a set of marijuana-related queries. Original content was separated from reposted content (retweets), and foreign language tweets and those not related to marijuana were excluded. Using a structured codebook, tweet content was categorized (e.g., mention of personal marijuana use, parents' views, perceived effects.) Self-reported age was extracted from tweet metadata when available. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in content by whether the user self-identified as an adolescent and to compare content pre- versus post-election. The full sample consisted of 71,901 tweets. After excluding nonrelevant tweets and separating original tweets from retweets, the analytic sample included 36,969 original tweets. A majority (65.6%) of original tweets by adolescents (n=1,928) reflected a positive attitude toward marijuana, and 42.9% indicated personal use. Of adolescents' tweets that mentioned parents, 36.0% of tweets indicated parental support for the adolescent's marijuana use. Tweets about personal marijuana use increased from 2012 to 2013, as did positive perceptions about the drug. Adolescents and others on Twitter are exposed to positive discussion normalizing use.

This article aims to analyzes data related to the victims of ATT recorded by the Justice Secretariat and Public Security (SEJUSP) in hospital morbidity and mortality incidence at the city of Cuiaba-MT during 2006, using data mining technology. An observational, retrospective and exploratory study of the secondary data bases was carried out. The three database selected were related using the probabilistic method, through the free software RecLink. One hundred and thirty-nine (139) real pairs of victims of ATT were obtained. In this related database the data mining technology was applied with the software WEKA using the Apriori algorithm.

{"abstract":"Online social networking sites (SNS) are popular social tools used amongst adolescents and account for much of their daily internet activity. Recently, these sites have presented opportunities for youth to experience cyber-bullying. Often resulting in psychological distress, cyber-bullying is a common experience for many young people. Continual use of SNS signifies the importance of examining its links to cyber-bullying. This study examined the relationship between online social networking and the experience of cyber-bullying. A total of 400 participants (Mage=14.31 years) completed an online survey which examined the perceived definitions and frequency of cyber-bullying. Users of SNS reported significantly higher frequencies of stranger contact compared to non-users. Spearman's rho correlations determined no significant relationship between daily time on SNS and the frequency of stranger contact. This suggests that ownership of a SNS profile may be a stronger predictor of some cyber-bullying experiences compared to time spent on these sites. Findings encourage continued research on the nature of internet activities used by young adolescents and the possible exposure to online victimization.

{"abstract":"How do we recognize ourselves as the agents of our actions? Do we use the same error detection mechanisms to monitor self-generated vs. externally imposed actions? Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we identified two different error-monitoring loops involved in providing a coherent sense of the agency of our actions. In the first ERP experiment, the participants were embodied in a virtual body (avatar) while performing an error-prone fast reaction time task. Crucially, in certain trials, participants were deceived regarding their own actions, i.e., the avatar movement did not match the participant's movement. Self-generated real errors and false (avatar) errors showed very different ERP signatures and with different processing latencies: while real errors showed a classical frontal-central error-related negativity (Ne\/ERN), peaking 100ms after error commission, false errors elicited a larger and delayed parietal negative component (at about 350-400ms). The violation of the sense of agency elicited by false avatar errors showed a strong similarity to ERP signatures related to semantic or conceptual violations (N400 component). In a follow-up ERP control experiment, a subset of the same participants merely acted as observers of the avatar correct and error movements. This experimental situation did not elicit the N400 component associated with agency violation. Thus, the present results show a clear neural dissociation between internal and external error-monitoring loops responsible for distinguishing our self-generated errors from those imposed externally, opening new avenues for the study of the mental processes underlying the integration of internal and sensory feedback information while being actors of our own actions.

{"abstract":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant health concern for U.S. military service members (SMs) returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Early intervention to prevent chronic disability requires greater understanding of subthreshold PTSD symptoms, which are associated with impaired physical health, mental health, and risk for delayed onset PTSD. We report a comparison of physiologic responses for recently deployed SMs with high and low subthreshold PTSD symptoms, respectively, to a fear conditioning task and novel virtual reality paradigm (Virtual Iraq). The high symptom group demonstrated elevated heart rate (HR) response during fear conditioning. Virtual reality sequences evoked significant HR responses which predicted variance of the PTSD Checklist-Military Version self-report. Our results support the value of physiologic assessment during fear conditioning and combat-related virtual reality exposure as complementary tools in detecting subthreshold PTSD symptoms in Veterans.

{"abstract":"Driver sleepiness due to sleep deprivation is a causative factor of many road accidents. Reducing the extent of the sleepy driving problem by developing a countermeasure device that will monitor the sleepiness level of the driver is crucial to improve the safety of the roads. Among numerous physiological measurements, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal seems to be the most sensitive to detect sleepiness. Previous studies in the field have found consistent alterations of EEG signal during sleepy driving, though they face methodological limitations. We present here preliminary results from a real-driving experiment in which a more complete experimental setup was followed. The subjects were exposed to driving conditions twice: once after they had a normal sleep during the previous night, and once after they remained awake for at least 24 hours prior to the experiment. Significant alterations were observed in the alpha and beta EEG frequencies bands between the two sessions. Electroopthalmographic (EOG) measurements revealed an increased number of eye blinking during the sleep-deprived session in comparison to the control condition. Both measurements can be used for the successful design of a sleepiness detection countermeasure device. Language: en","authors":["Christos Papadelis","C.

{"abstract":"Individual's decisions, from what product to buy to whether to engage in risky behavior, often depend on the choices, behaviors, or states of other people. People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual's local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the \"majority illusion,\" leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.

{"abstract":"Objective To determine the association between the frequencies of pharmaceutical exposures reported to a poison control center (PCC) and those seen in the emergency department (ED). Design A statewide population-based retrospective comparison of frequencies of ED pharmaceutical poisonings with frequencies of pharmaceutical exposures reported to a regional PCC. ED poisonings, identified by International Classification of Diseases, Version 9 (ICD-9) codes, were grouped into substance categories. Using a reproducible algorithm facilitated by probabilistic linkage, codes from the PCC classification system were mapped into the same categories. A readily identifiable subset of PCC calls was selected for comparison. Measurements Correlations between frequencies of quarterly exposures by substance categories were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients with adjustment for seasonality. Results PCC reported exposures correlated with ED poisonings in nine of 10 categories. Partial correlation coefficients (r(p)) indicated strong associations (r(p)>0.8) for three substance categories that underwent large changes in their incidences (opiates, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxants). Six substance categories were moderately correlated (r(p)>0.6). One category, salicylates, showed no association. Limitations Imperfect overlap between ICD-9 and PCC codes may have led to miscategorization. Substances without changes in exposure frequency have inadequate variability to detect association using this method. Conclusion PCC data are able to effectively identify trends in poisonings seen in EDs and may be useful as part of a pharmaceutical poisoning surveillance system. The authors developed an algorithm-driven technique for mapping American Association of Poison Control Centers codes to ICD-9 codes and identified a useful subset of poison control exposures for analysis.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Suicide issue is of great concern in China. Social media provides an active approach to understanding suicide individuals in terms of their behavior and language use. Aims: This study investigates how suicide Microblog users in China act and speak differently on social media from others. METHODS: Hypothesis testing in behavioral and linguistic features was performed between a target group of 33 Chinese Microblog users who have committed suicide and a control group of 30 active users without suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Suicide group significantly outnumbered control group in the extent of openly published posts and self-reference, and the intensity of using 7 word categories: negative words\/social process words\/cognitive process words\/emotion process words\/negative emotion words\/exclusive words\/physiological process words. Limitations: Information collection and confirmation of suicide users remain difficult. CONCLUSIONS: It is revealed that suicide people vary from others in certain behavioral and linguistic features in social media.

{"abstract":"This study explores behavioural determinants of defending behaviour in cyberbullying incidents. Three focus groups were conducted with youngsters aged 12-16y. Major themes that were found as important behavioural determinants to defend the victim were a low moral disengagement, that the victim is an in-group member and that the bystander is popular. Bystanders preferred to handle cyberbullying offline and in person, and comforting the victim was considered more feasible than facing the bully. With a high peer acceptance of passive bystanding and lack of parental support for defending behaviour, youngsters do not receive much encouragement from their environment to exhibit defending behaviour towards victims. These preliminary results suggest befriending and peer support interventions hold promise, as well as environmental interventions with parents and teachers. These first results will need to be confirmed in more in-depth analyses and in quantitative research.

{"abstract":"Rule-based and corpus-based machine translation (MT) have coexisted for more than 20 years. Recently, boundaries between the two paradigms have narrowed and hybrid approaches are gaining interest from both academia and businesses. However, since hybrid approaches involve the multidisciplinary interaction of linguists, computer scientists, engineers, and information specialists, understandably a number of issues exist. While statistical methods currently dominate research work in MT, most commercial MT systems are technically hybrid systems. The research community should investigate the benefits and questions surrounding the hybridization of MT systems more actively. This paper discusses various issues related to hybrid MT including its origins, architectures, achievements, and frustrations experienced in the community. It can be said that both rule-based and corpus- based MT systems have benefited from hybridization when effectively integrated. In fact, many of the current rule\/corpus-based MT approaches are already hybridized since they do include statistics\/rules at some point.

{"abstract":"The spatial nature of crash data highlights the importance of employing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in different fields of safety research. Recently, numerous studies have been carried out in safety analysis to investigate the relationships between crashes and related factors. Trip generation as a function of land use, socio-economic, and demographic characteristics might be appropriate variables along with network characteristics and traffic volume to develop safety models. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) describe the relationships between crashes and the explanatory variables by estimating the global and fixed coefficients. Since crash occurrences are almost certainly influenced by many spatial factors; the main objective of this study is to employ Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) on 253 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in Mashhad, Iran, using traffic volume, network characteristics and trip generation variables to investigate the aspects of relationships which do not emerge when using conventional global specifications. GWPR showed an improvement in model performance as indicated by goodness-of-fit criteria. The results also indicated the non-stationary state in the relationships between the number of crashes and all independent variables.

{"abstract":"Online Radicalization (also called Cyber-Terrorism or Extremism or Cyber-Racism or Cyber- Hate) is widespread and has become a major and growing concern to the society, governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Research shows that various platforms on the Internet (low barrier to publish content, allows anonymity, provides exposure to millions of users and a potential of a very quick and widespread diffusion of message) such as YouTube (a popular video sharing website), Twitter (an online micro-blogging service), Facebook (a popular social networking website), online discussion forums and blogosphere are being misused for malicious intent. Such platforms are being used to form hate groups, racist communities, spread extremist agenda, incite anger or violence, promote radicalization, recruit members and create virtual organi- zations and communities. Automatic detection of online radicalization is a technically challenging problem because of the vast amount of the data, unstructured and noisy user-generated content, dynamically changing content and adversary behavior. There are several solutions proposed in the literature aiming to combat and counter cyber-hate and cyber-extremism. In this survey, we review solutions to detect and analyze online radicalization. We review 40 papers published at 12 venues from June 2003 to November 2011. We present a novel classification scheme to classify these papers. We analyze these techniques, perform trend analysis, discuss limitations of existing techniques and find out research gaps.

{"abstract":"Inspired by the fact that people have diverse propensities to punish wrongdoers, we study a spatial public goods game with defectors and different types of punishing cooperators. During the game, cooperators punish defectors with class-specific probabilities and subsequently share the associated costs of sanctioning. We show that in the presence of different punishing cooperators the highest level of public cooperation is always attainable through a selection mechanism. Interestingly, the selection does not necessarily favor the evolution of punishers who would be able to prevail on their own against the defectors, nor does it always hinder the evolution of punishers who would be unable to prevail on their own. Instead, the evolutionary success of punishing strategies depends sensitively on their invasion velocities, which in turn reveals fascinating examples of both competition and cooperation among them. Furthermore, we show that under favorable conditions, when punishment is not strictly necessary for the maintenance of public cooperation, the less aggressive, mild form of sanctioning is the sole victor of the selection process. Our work reveals that natural strategy selection cannot only promote, but sometimes also hinders competition among prosocial strategies.

Fourteen hand dimensions relevant to glove design were measured. A cluster analysis of the hand dimensions was performed to explore options for an improved sizing scheme. RESULTS: The current national standard structural firefighting glove-sizing scheme underrepresents firefighter hand size range and shape variation. In addition, mismatch between existing sizing specifications and hand characteristics, such as hand dimensions, user selection of glove size, and the existing glove sizing specifications, is significant. An improved glove-sizing plan based on clusters of overall hand size and hand\/finger breadth-to-length contrast has been developed. CONCLUSION: This study presents the most up-to-date firefighter hand anthropometry and a new perspective on glove accommodation. The new seven-size system contains narrower variations (standard deviations) for almost all dimensions for each glove size than the current sizing practices. APPLICATION: The proposed science-based sizing plan for structural firefighting gloves provides a step-forward perspective (i.e., including two women hand model-based sizes and two wide-palm sizes for men) for glove manufacturers to advance firefighter hand protection.

{"abstract":"A wide spectrum of extreme events ranging from traffic jams to floods take place on networks. Motivated by these, we employ a random walk model for transport and obtain analytical and numerical results for the extreme events on networks. They reveal an unforeseen, and yet a robust, feature: small degree nodes of a network are more likely to encounter extreme events than the hubs. Further, we also study the recurrence time distribution and scaling of the probabilities for extreme events. These results suggest a revision of design principles and can be used as an input for designing the nodes of a network so as to smoothly handle extreme events.

{"abstract":"Understanding the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users is essential to designing search interfaces that support them during their search tasks. In a previous article, we reported the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users when performing complex search tasks on the web, and we examined the difficulties encountered when interacting with search interfaces via speech-based screen readers. In this article, we use our previous findings to inform the design of a search interface to support visually impaired users for complex information seeking. We particularly focus on implementing TrailNote, a tool to support visually impaired searchers in managing the search process, and we also redesign the spelling-support mechanism using nonspeech sounds to address previously observed difficulties in interacting with this feature. To enhance the user experience, we have designed interface features to be technically accessible as well as usable with speech-based screen readers. We have evaluated the proposed interface with 12 visually impaired users and studied how they interacted with the interface components. Our findings show that the search interface was effective in supporting participants for complex information seeking and that the proposed interface features were accessible and usable with speech-based screen readers.

{"abstract":"Researchers face substantial challenges when conducting household surveys in technologically less developed regions, such as parts of Africa , or in disaster affected areas. Lack of detailed maps, location of houses, and valid addresses are impediments to conducting surveys in the region. This study presents an alternative through the use of a novel approach that allows a interview teams to overcome the aforementioned problems. An interview team, each equipped with a personal digital assistant (PDA) with global positioning system (GPS) unit, can accomplish all tasks needed to collect statistically valid survey data with high performance metrics. This technology has been used to conduct surveys in regions affected by malaria in Togo, Niger, and Mozambique. This poster demonstrates the use of pre-programmed PDAs with geopositioning capacity using GPS survey selection software, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to conduct a statistically valid assessment and present preliminary analyses within 24 hours of the last completed survey. The software application (GPS Survey, version 2.0) allows rapid mapping of all households in the survey area, as well as landmarks, for spatial analysis. It allows the researcher to choose a statistically valid sample of households and navigate back to them to conduct interviews. During the interview, the program leads the interviewer with preprogrammed skip patterns, checks and safely stores data upon entry, and downloads data to a computer for rapid analysis. Initial analysis of Mozambique household mapping data revealed that using the aforementioned technology, location of 4855 houses dispersed in 32 villages or neighborhoods in 8 districts of Manica and Sofala provinces of Mozambique were mapped in 10 days using 18 field interviewers. Data were aggregated, analyzed, and presented in less than a day. Using GPS 2.0 software application, mapping of individual houses within each enumeration area, spanning several square kilometers, was completed in between 3.5 and 4.5 hours. The application of PDA and GPS based technology to conduct surveys in remote regions of Mozambique was important in assuring data quality, obtaining a statistically accurate random sample with geospatial data, substantially reducing the data entry time, and rapidly making data available for analysis.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We review historical and more recent efforts in boredom research and related fields. A framework is presented that organizes the various facets of boredom, particularly in supervisory control settings, and research gaps and future potential areas for study are highlighted. BACKGROUND: Given the ubiquity of boredom across a wide spectrum of work environments-exacerbated by increasingly automated systems that remove humans from direct, physical system interaction and possibly increasing tedium in the workplace-there is a need not only to better understand the multiple facets of boredom in work environments but to develop targeted mitigation strategies. METHOD: To better understand the relationships between the various influences and outcomes of boredom, a systems-based framework, called the Boredom Influence Diagram, is proposed that describes various elements of boredom and their interrelationships. RESULTS: Boredom is closely related to vigilance, attention management, and task performance. This review highlights the need to develop more naturalistic experiments that reflect the characteristics of a boring work environment. CONCLUSION: With the increase in automation, boredom in the workplace will likely become a more prevalent issue for motivation and retention. In addition, developing continuous measures of boredom based on physiological signals is critical. APPLICATION: Personnel selection and improvements in system and task design can potentially mitigate boredom. However, more work is needed to develop and evaluate other potential interventions.

{"abstract":"Adolescents have an increased need to regulate their behavior as they gain access to opportunities for risky behavior; however, cognitive control systems necessary for this regulation remain relatively immature. Parents can impact their adolescent child's abilities to regulate their behavior and engagement in risk taking. Since adolescents undergo significant neural change, negative parent-child relationship quality may impede or alter development in prefrontal regions subserving cognitive control. To test this hypothesis, 20 adolescents completed a go\/nogo task during two fMRI scans occurring 1 year apart. Adolescents reporting greater family conflict and lower family cohesion showed longitudinal increases in risk-taking behavior, which was mediated by longitudinal increases in left VLPFC activation during cognitive control. These results underscore the importance of parent-child relationships during early adolescence, and the neural processes by which cognitive control may be derailed and lead to increased risk taking.

{"abstract":"The combination of active video gaming and exercise (exergaming) is suggested to improve elderly people's balance, thereby decreasing fall risk. Exergaming has been shown to increase motivation during exercise therapy, due to the enjoyable and challenging nature, which could support long-term adherence for exercising balance. However, scarce evidence is available of the direct effects of exergaming on postural control. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the effect of a six-week videogame-based exercise program aimed at improving balance in elderly people. Task performance and postural control were examined using an interrupted time series design. Results of multilevel analyses showed that performance on the dot task improved within the first two weeks of training. Postural control improved during the intervention. After the intervention period task performance and balance were better than before the intervention. Results of this study show that healthy elderly can benefit from a videogame-based exercise program to improve balance and that all subjects were highly motivated to exercise balance because they found gaming challenging and enjoyable.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine variations in drivers' foot behavior and identify factors associated with pedal misapplications. BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the foot behavior while in the vehicle and the mishaps that a driver can encounter during a potentially hazardous situation. METHOD: A driving simulation study was used to understand how drivers move their right foot toward the pedals. The study included data from 43 drivers as they responded to a series of rapid traffic signal phase changes. Pedal application types were classified as (a) direct hit, (b) hesitated, (c) corrected trajectory, and (d) pedal errors (incorrect trajectories, misses, slips, or pressed both pedals). A mixed-effects multinomial logit model was used to predict the likelihood of one of these pedal applications, and linear mixed models with repeated measures were used to examine the response time and pedal duration given the various experimental conditions (stimuli color and location). RESULTS: Younger drivers had higher probabilities of direct hits when compared to other age groups. Participants tended to have more pedal errors when responding to a red signal or when the signal appeared to be closer. Traffic signal phases and locations were associated with pedal response time and duration. The response time and pedal duration affected the likelihood of being in one of the four pedal application types. CONCLUSION AND APPLICATION: Findings from this study suggest that age-related and situational factors may play a role in pedal errors, and the stimuli locations could affect the type of pedal application.

{"abstract":"Thesauri and other types of controlled vocabularies are increasingly re-engineered into ontologies described using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), particularly in the life sciences. This has led to the perception by some that thesauri are ontologies once they are described by using the syntax of OWL while others have emphasized the need to re-engineer a vocabulary to use it as ontology. This confusion is rooted in different perceptions of what ontologies are and how they differ from other types of vocabularies. In this article, we rigorously examine the structural differences and similarities between thesauri and meaning-defining ontologies described in OWL. Specifically, we conduct (a) a conceptual comparison of thesauri and ontologies, and (b) a comparison of a specific thesaurus and a specific ontology in the same subject field. Our results show that thesauri and ontologies need to be treated as 2 orthogonal kinds of models with superficially similar structures. An ontology is not a good thesaurus, nor is a thesaurus a good ontology. A thesaurus requires significant structural and other content changes to become an ontology, and vice versa.

{"abstract":"In this global information age, accessing, disseminating, and controlling information is an increasingly important aspect of human life. Often, these interests are expressed in the language of human rights--for example, rights to expression, privacy, and intellectual property. As the discipline concerned with \"facilitating the effective communication of desired information between human generator and human user\" (Belkin, 1975, p. 22), library and information science (LIS) has a central role in facilitating communication about human rights and ensuring the respect for human rights in information services and systems. This paper surveys the literature at the intersection of LIS and human rights. To begin, an overview of human rights conventions and an introduction to human rights theory is provided. Then the intersections between LIS and human rights are considered. Three central areas of informational human rights--communication, privacy, and intellectual property--are discussed in detail. It is argued that communication rights in particular serve as a central linchpin in the system of human rights.

{"abstract":"Great cities connect people; failed cities isolate people. Despite the fundamental importance of physical, face-to-face social ties in the functioning of cities, these connectivity networks are not explicitly observed in their entirety. Attempts at estimating them often rely on unrealistic over-simplifications such as the assumption of spatial homogeneity. Here we propose a mathematical model of human interactions in terms of a local strategy of maximizing the number of beneficial connections attainable under the constraint of limited individual travelling-time budgets. By incorporating census and openly available online multi-modal transport data, we are able to characterize the connectivity of geometrically and topologically complex cities. Beyond providing a candidate measure of greatness, this model allows one to quantify and assess the impact of transport developments, population growth, and other infrastructure and demographic changes on a city. Supported by validations of gross domestic product and human immunodeficiency virus infection rates across US metropolitan areas, we illustrate the effect of changes in local and city-wide connectivities by considering the economic impact of two contemporary inter- and intra-city transport developments in the UK: High Speed 2 and London Crossrail. This derivation of the model suggests that the scaling of different urban indicators with population size has an explicitly mechanistic origin. Language: en","authors":["Aaron Sim","Sophia N.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined how providing artificially high or low statements about automation reliability affected expectations, perceptions, and use of automation over time. BACKGROUND: One common method of introducing automation is providing explicit statements about the automation's capabilities. Research is needed to understand how expectations from such introductions affect perceptions and use of automation. METHOD: Explicit-statement introductions were manipulated to set higher-than (90%), same-as (75%), or lower-than (60%) levels of expectations in a dual-task scenario with 75% reliable automation. Two experiments were conducted to assess expectations, perceptions, compliance, reliance, and task performance over (a) 2 days and (b) 4 days. RESULTS: The baseline assessments showed initial expectations of automation reliability matched introduced levels of expectation. For the duration of each experiment, the lower-than groups' perceptions were lower than the actual automation reliability. However, the higher-than groups' perceptions were no different from actual automation reliability after Day 1 in either study. There were few differences between groups for automation use, which generally stayed the same or increased with experience using the system. CONCLUSION: Introductory statements describing artificially low automation reliability have a long-lasting impact on perceptions about automation performance. Statements including incorrect automation reliability do not appear to affect use of automation. APPLICATION: Introductions should be designed according to desired outcomes for expectations, perceptions, and use of the automation. Low expectations have long-lasting effects.

{"abstract":"Transportation officers at mass casualty incidents arefaced with the daunting task of tracking large amounts of patients as they leave the disaster scene. Patients often leave under their own power without notifying any authorities, presenting a problem for personnel attempting to account for every patient they have treated. This paper describes a system of tracking patients at a disaster scene or en route to hospitals using electronic triage tags registered with an external database. Background: A major challenge for disaster response informationsystems is to provide capabilities without being obtrusiveto the already overburdened responders. The AdvancedHealth and Disaster Aid Network (AID-N) has developed electronic triage tags that provide ubiquitous and automated geolocation of patients in both indoor and outdoor settings. When patients are tagged with electronic triage tags, they are automatically tracked by the software system, no additional input from the medics is required. The tags, based upon the smart dust hardware platform, are small, lightweight, easy to apply, and cost-effective for easy employment at mass casualty disasters. Unlike GPS-based tracking technologies, the setags are low-power and do not require a clear line of sight. To this end, AID-N provides a sophisticatedpatient tracking mechanism that meets the needs of theemergency responders. Implementation: After any MCI, emergency response services are required to account for any patients they registered at the disaster scene. The current system requires a transportation officer at the scene to fill out a form with patient details and destination information each time a patient is put inan ambulance. However, during a chaotic disaster scene,the overwhelmed responders often neglect to fill out the paperwork or lose the paperwork. Under our new system, all of the patient locality logging is electronic and automated. Emergency personnel can now locate any patient from a MCI in real-time, instead of waiting until after the MCI is concluded.The location of patients wearing tags is based on theproximity of the tags to: 1) handheld device carried by nomadic medics, 2) base stations laptops installed inside ambulances coming in and out of the disaster site, 3)laptops stationed at designated zones of the disaster site,and 4) other tags in the wireless mesh network. Each base station and handheld device is equipped with a GPS sensor. Language: en","authors":["Alexander M.

{"abstract":"If people with high risk of suicide can be identified through social media like microblog, it is possible to implement an active intervention system to save their lives. Based on this motivation, the current study administered the Suicide Probability Scale(SPS) to 1041 weibo users at Sina Weibo, which is a leading microblog service provider in China. Two NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods, the Chinese edition of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) lexicon and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used to extract linguistic features from the Sina Weibo data. We trained predicting models by machine learning algorithm based on these two types of features, to estimate suicide probability based on linguistic features. The experiment results indicate that LDA can find topics that relate to suicide probability, and improve the performance of prediction. Our study adds value in prediction of suicidal probability of social network users with their behaviors.

{"abstract":"'Symbolic violence' is committed, however well-intentionally, by the imposition of particular conceptualizations of what information, in what form and quality, is needed in order to make an 'informed choice' and hence - by questionable segue - a high quality decision. The social and cultural forms of relevant cognitive capital possessed by those who fail, because of their low general literacy, professionally-set knowledge tests of functional health literacy, are being ignored. Failing to recognise and exploit a particular form of functional decision literacy, in fact leads to symbolic violence being experienced by individuals at any and all levels of general literacy. It leads many to adopt the same range of avoidant and other undesirable strategies within healthcare situations observed in those of low basic literacy. The alternative response we propose exploits the alternative generic decision literacy which comes in the form of the ability to access and use the decision-relevant resources provided for many consumer services and products on comparison websites and magazines. The methodology is the simple form of multi-criteria analysis in which the products' ratings on multiple criteria are combined with criterion weights (supplied by the site) to produce scores and 'best buys' and 'good value for money' verdicts. Our alternative approach extends this approach to healthcare options and permits the incorporation of personal criterion weights in furtherance of person-centred care. Health informaticians, especially those in the decision support field, should build on this widespread generic competence. The fact that it is generic, far from implying context insensitivity, can be seen as a necessary basis for achieving context-sensitivity and sensitivisation at the level of the individual person as they experience a lifelong sequence of healthcare decisions.

{"abstract":"Bias in peer review entails systematic prejudice that prevents accurate and objective assessment of scientific studies. The disparity between referees' opinions on the same paper typically makes it difficult to judge the paper's quality. This article presents a comprehensive study of peer review biases with regard to 2 aspects of referees: the static profiles (factual authority and self-reported confidence) and the dynamic behavioral context (the temporal ordering of reviews by a single reviewer), exploiting anonymized, real-world review reports of 2 different international conferences in information systems \/ computer science. Our work extends conventional bias research by considering multiple biases occurring simultaneously. Our findings show that the referees' static profiles are more dominant in peer review bias when compared to their dynamic behavioral context. Of the static profiles, self-reported confidence improved both conference fitness and impact-based bias reductions, while factual authority could only contribute to conference fitness-based bias reduction. Our results also clearly show that the reliability of referees' judgments varies along their static profiles and is contingent on the temporal interval between 2 consecutive reviews.

{"abstract":"Schools and teachers nowadays face new difficulties and challenges as a result of the fast growth of cyberbullying. The aim of the study is to examine the perceptions, beliefs and concerns about cyberbullying, as well as the needs, of a professionally diverse group of teachers. Three-hundred and twenty-eight teachers (88.4% female, 11.6% male) from different types of schools and professional foci were randomly selected and completed a cyberbullying questionnaire regarding their perceptions of cyberbullying and about their personal experiences in relation to cyberbullying. They also provided background information. FINDINGS indicate that teachers noted that cyberbullying is a problem in their school, suggesting that urgent attention be paid to three aspects: policy making, enhancing awareness of the school team and coping strategies for parents. About half the teachers reported that students complain of harassment through the mobile phone and Internet, and some teachers were themselves cyberbullied. It was found that the teachers' gender, education level and the age of the students they taught affected their level of concern about cyberbullying, and therefore how credible they found the school's commitment to act on it. Female teachers expressed more concern than male teachers, as did teachers of younger children. Special education teachers were more concerned than mainstream teachers and were more likely to believe that the cyberbullying must be confronted. The results contribute to our understanding of the teachers' perceptions, beliefs and concerns about cyberbullying, which could serve as a basis for developing policy guidelines in schools as well as establishing programs for school teachers to cope with cyberbullying.

{"abstract":"The recent interest in Big Data has generated a broad range of new academic, corporate, and policy practices along with an evolving debate among its proponents, detractors, and skeptics. While the practices draw on a common set of tools, techniques, and technologies, most contributions to the debate come either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with a focus on a domain-specific issue. A close examination of these contributions reveals a set of common problematics that arise in various guises and in different places. It also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data. The purpose of this article is to provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences, humanities, policy, and trade literature. In bringing these diverse literatures together, we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and affect all of these areas. By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within larger socioeconomic developments, we also seek to provide a broader understanding of its drivers, barriers, and challenges. This approach allows us to identify attributes of Big Data that require more attention--autonomy, opacity, generativity, disparity, and futurity--leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of optic flow on gait behavior during treadmill walking using an immersive virtual reality (VR) setup and compare it with conventional treadmill walking (TW) and overground walking (OW). BACKGROUND: Previous research comparing TW with OW speculated that a lack of optic flow (relative visual movement between a walker and the environment) during TW may have led to perceptual cue conflicts, resulting in differences in gait behavior, as compared with OW. METHOD: Participants walked under three locomotion conditions (OW, TW, and TW with VR [TWVR]) under three walking constraint conditions (no constraint, a temporal\/pacing constraint, and a spatial\/path-following constraint). Presence questionnaires (PQs) were administered at the close of the TWVR trials. Trials were subjected to video analysis to determine spatiotemporal and kinematics variables used for comparison of locomotion conditions. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed gait behavior during TWVR to be between that of OW and TW. Speed and cadence during TWVR were significantly different from those of TW, whereas knee angle was comparable to that of OW. Correlation analysis of PQ scores with gait measures revealed a positive linear association of the distraction subfactor of the PQ with walking speed during TWVR, suggesting an increase in the sense of presence in the virtual environment led to increases in walking speed. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that providing optic flow during TW through VR has an impact on gait behavior. APPLICATION: This study provides a basis for developing simple VR locomotion interface setups for gait research. Language: en","authors":["Mohamed A. Sheik-Nainar","David B.

{"abstract":"In every day life, people select motor responses according to arbitrary rules. For example, our movements while driving a car can be instructed by color cues that we see on traffic lights. These stimuli do not spatially relate to the actions that they specify. Associations between these stimuli and actions are called arbitrary visuomotor conditional associations. Earlier fMRI studies have tried to dissociate the sensory and motor components of these associations by introducing delays between the presentation of arbitrary cues and go-signals that instructed participants to perform actions. This approach, however, also introduces neural processes that are not necessarily related to the normal real-time production of arbitrary visuomotor responses, such as working memory and the suppression of motor responses. We used fMRI adaptation as an alternative approach to dissociate sensory and motor components. We found that visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex adapted only to the presentation of arbitrary visual cues whereas a number of sensorimotor areas adapted only to the production of response. Visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex do not have any known connections with parts of the brain that can control hand musculature. Therefore, it is conceivable that the brain areas that we report as having adapted to both stimulus presentation and response production (namely, the dorsal premotor area, the supplementary motor area, the cingulate, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus area, and the thalamus) are involved in the multiple steps between processing visual stimuli and activating the motor commands that these cues specify.

{"abstract":"Portable media consoles are becoming extremely popular devices for viewing a number of different types of media content, both for entertainment and for educational purposes. Given the increasingly heavy use of portable consoles as an alternative to traditional television-style monitors, it is important to investigate how physiological and psychological effects of portable consoles may differ from those of television-based consoles, because such differences in physiological and psychological responses may precipitate differences in the delivered content's effectiveness. Because portable consoles are popular as a delivery system for multiple types of media content, such as movies and video games, it is also important to investigate whether differences between the effects of portable and television-based consoles are consistent across multiple types of media. This article reports a 2 x 2 (console: portable or television-based x medium: video game or movie) mixed factorial design experiment with physiological arousal and self-reported flow experience as dependent variables, designed to explore whether console type affects media experiences and whether these effects are consistent across different media. Results indicate that portable media consoles evoke lower levels of physiological arousal and flow experience and that this effect is consistent for both video games and movies. These findings suggest that even though portable media consoles are often convenient compared to television-based consoles, the convenience may come at a cost in terms of the user experience.

{"abstract":"Naturalistic paradigms such as movie watching or simulated driving that mimic closely real-world complex activities are becoming more widely used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies both because of their ability to robustly stimulate brain connectivity and the availability of analysis methods which are able to capitalize on connectivity within and among intrinsic brain networks identified both during a task and in resting fMRI data. In this paper we review over a decade of work from our group and others on the use of simulated driving paradigms to study both the healthy brain as well as the effects of acute alcohol administration on functional connectivity during such paradigms. We briefly review our initial work focused on the configuration of the driving simulator and the analysis strategies. We then describe in more detail several recent studies from our group including a hybrid study examining distracted driving and compare resulting data with those from a separate visual oddball task (Fig. 6). The analysis of these data was performed primarily using a combination of group independent component analysis (ICA) and the general linear model (GLM) and in the various studies we highlight novel findings which result from an analysis of either 1) within-network connectivity, 2) inter-network connectivity, also called functional network connectivity, or 3) the degree to which the modulation of the various intrinsic networks were associated with the alcohol administration and the task context. Despite the fact that the behavioral effects of alcohol intoxication are relatively well known, there is still much to discover on how acute alcohol exposure modulates brain function in a selective manner, associated with behavioral alterations. Through the above studies, we have learned more regarding the impact of acute alcohol intoxication on organization of the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks during performance of a complex, real-world cognitive operation. Lessons learned from the above studies have broader applicability to designing ecologically valid, complex, functional MRI cognitive paradigms and incorporating pharmacologic challenges into such studies. Overall, the use of hybrid driving studies is a particularly promising area of neuroscience investigation. Keywords: Driver distraction; Language: en","authors":["Vince D. Calhoun","Godfrey D.

{"abstract":"Over half of Australia's population lives in its southeastern quadrant. Temperature records for the 55-year period 1958-2013 indicate that hot summers have occurred increasingly since the 1990s with daily maximum temperatures reaching 10 \u00b0C above normal. The extreme nature of the change in monthly mean maximum temperatures (\u223c1 to 1.5 \u00b0C above the long term mean) far exceeds the natural variability expected over a half century. Numerous maximum temperature records have been set and the extreme heat poses a major socioeconomic threat. This work examines changes in mean values of maximum daily temperatures for each summer month, in southeastern Australia. A 10-site dataset, for 1958-2013, was drawn and resampled to quantify temporal changes and uncertainty in decadal monthly maximum temperatures. Resampling methods documented the historical uniqueness of the maximum temperatures in recent decades. RESULTS suggest strongly that, in recent decades, the maximum temperatures exceeding the upper quartile of the historical data is greater than expected by random chance. The findings confirm the regional nature of the warming. The increase in summer temperature is partly related to changes in atmospheric blocking. Language: en","authors":["Michael B.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to determine the best location to place a conventional mobile computer supported by a commercially available mount in a light truck cab. BACKGROUND: U.S. and Canadian electric utility companies are in the process of integrating mobile computers into their fleet vehicle cabs. There are no publications on the effect of mobile computer location in a vehicle cab on biomechanical loading, performance, and subjective assessment. METHOD: The authors tested four locations of mobile computers in a light truck cab in a laboratory study to determine how location affected muscle activity of the lower back and shoulders; joint angles of the shoulders, elbows, and wrist; user performance; and subjective assessment. A total of 22 participants were tested in this study. RESULTS: Placing the mobile computer closer to the steering wheel reduced low back and shoulder muscle activity. Joint angles of the shoulders, elbows, and wrists were also closer to neutral angle. Biomechanical modeling revealed substantially less spinal compression and trunk muscle force. In general, there were no practical differences in performance between the locations. Subjective assessment indicated that users preferred the mobile computer to be as close as possible to the steering wheel. CONCLUSION: Locating the mobile computer close to the steering wheel reduces risk of injuries, such as low back pain and shoulder tendonitis.

{"abstract":"There is an increasing awareness of the importance and the benefits to be attained from consulting the end-users during system and product development. Although the rationale of utilizing the expertise of end-users in the system development life cycle appears to provide an apparently straightforward, even 'ideal' approach, there are many difficulties associated with eliciting the required knowledge from experts, both general and specific to every user group. Furthermore, many developers do not know how to involve users, or if they do, they do not utilize them to best effect. In the avionics sphere, the wealth of knowledge possessed by line pilots and flight engineers represents a vital information resource for the design of future flight-deck systems. As a specific example, this paper overviews some of the considerations which arose from working with these end-users in the early stages of the development of a warning and diagnostic system for civil aircraft. The end-goal of this particular phase of the work was the generation of guidelines for the design of the interface for the software engineers to use when building the prototype, and the methodological approach taken to achieve this is reported here.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A pair of simulated driving experiments studied the effects of cognitive load on drivers' lane-keeping performance. BACKGROUND: Cognitive load while driving often reduces the variability of lane position. However, there is no agreement as to whether this effect should be interpreted as a performance loss, consistent with other effects of distraction on driving, or as an anomalous performance gain. METHOD: Participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator performed a lane-keeping task in lateral wind,with instructions to keep a steady lane position. Under high load conditions, participants performed a concurrent working memory task with auditory stimuli. Cross-spectral analysis measured the relationship between wind force and steering inputs. RESULTS: Cognitive load reduced the variability of lane position and increased the coupling between steering wheel position and crosswind strength. CONCLUSION: Although cognitive load disrupts driver performance in a variety of ways, it produces a performance gain in lane keeping.This effect appears to reflect drivers' efforts to protect lateral control against the risk of distraction, at the apparent neglect of other elements of driving performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We show how to choose colors for icons on maps to minimize search time using predictions of a model of visual search. BACKGROUND: The model analyzes digital images of a search target (an icon on a map) and a search display (the map containing the icon) and predicts search time as a function of target-distractor color distinctiveness and target eccentricity. METHOD: We parameterized the model using data from a visual search task and performed a series of optimization tasks to test the model's ability to choose colors for icons to minimize search time across icons. Map display designs made by this procedure were tested experimentally. In a follow-up experiment, we examined the model's flexibility to assign colors in novel search situations. RESULTS: The model fits human performance, performs well on the optimization tasks, and can choose colors for icons on maps with novel stimuli to minimize search time without requiring additional model parameter fitting. CONCLUSION: Models of visual search can suggest color choices that produce search time reductions for display icons.

{"abstract":"Exposure to psychological trauma is common and predicts long-term physical and mental health problems, even in those who initially appear resilient. Here, we used multimodal neuroimaging in healthy adults who were at different distances from the World Trade Center on 9\/11\/01 to examine the neural mechanisms that may underlie this association. More than 3 years after 9\/11\/01, adults with closer proximity to the disaster had lower gray matter volume in amygdala, hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex, with control for age, gender, and total gray matter volume. Further analysis showed a nonlinear (first-order quadratic) association between total number of traumas in lifetime and amygdala gray matter volume and function in the whole group. Post hoc analysis of subgroups with higher versus lower levels of lifetime trauma exposure revealed systematic associations between amygdala gray matter volume, amygdala functional reactivity, and anxiety that suggest a nonlinear trajectory in the neural response to accumulated trauma in healthy adults.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct research synthesis for the U.S.Army on the effectiveness of two error prevention training strategies (training wheels and scaffolding) on the transfer of training. BACKGROUND: Motivated as part of an ongoing program of research on training effectiveness, the current work presents some of the program's research into the effects on transfer of error prevention strategies during training from a cognitive load perspective. Based on cognitive load theory, two training strategies were hypothesized to reduce intrinsic load by supporting learners early in acquisition during schema development. METHOD: A transfer ratio and Hedges' g were used in the two meta-analyses conducted on transfer studies employing the two training strategies. Moderators relevant to cognitive load theory and specific to the implemented strategies were examined.The transfer ratio was the ratio of treatment transfer performance to control transfer. Hedges' g was used in comparing treatment and control group standardized mean differences. Both effect sizes were analyzed with versions of sample weighted fixed effect models. RESULTS: Analysis of the training wheels strategy suggests a transfer benefit. The observed benefit was strongest when the training wheels were a worked example coupled with a principle-based prompt. Analysis of the scaffolding data also suggests a transfer benefit for the strategy. CONCLUSION: Both training wheels and scaffolding demonstrated positive transfer as training strategies.As error prevention techniques, both support the intrinsic load--reducing implications of cognitive load theory. APPLICATION: The findings are applicable to the development of instructional design guidelines in professional skill-based organizations such as the military.

{"abstract":"Emerging applications using body sensor networks (BSNs) constitute a new trend in car safety. However, the integration of heterogeneous body sensors with vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) poses a challenge, particularly on the detection of human behavioral states that may impair driving. This paper proposes a detector of human emotions, of which tiredness and stress (tension) could be related to traffic accidents. We present an exploratory study demonstrating the feasibility of detecting one emotional state in real time using a BSN. Based on these results, we propose middleware architecture that is able to detect emotions, which can be communicated via the onboard unit of a vehicle with city emergency services, VANETs, and roadside units, aimed at improving the driver's experience and at guaranteeing better security measures for the car driver. 2014 IEEE.

{"abstract":"In the collective-risk social dilemma, players lose their personal endowments if contributions to the common pool are too small. This fact alone, however, does not always deter selfish individuals from defecting. The temptations to free ride on the prosocial efforts of others are strong because we are hardwired to maximize our own fitness regardless of the consequences which might have for the public good. Here we show that the addition of risky assets to the personal endowments, both of which are lost if the collective target is not reached, can contribute to solving the collective-risk social dilemma. In infinite well-mixed populations, risky assets introduce new stable and unstable mixed steady states, whereby the stable mixed steady state converges to full cooperation as either the risk of collective failure or the amount of risky assets increases. Similarly, in finite well-mixed populations, the introduction of risky assets enforces configurations where cooperative behavior thrives. In structured populations cooperation is promoted as well, but the distribution of assets among the groups is crucial. Surprisingly, we find that the completely rational allocation of assets only to the most successful groups is not optimal, and this regardless of whether the risk of collective failure is high or low. Instead, in low-risk situations bounded rational allocation of assets works best, while in high-risk situations the simplest uniform distribution of assets among all the groups is optimal. These results indicate that prosocial behavior depends sensitively on the potential losses individuals are likely to endure if they fail to cooperate.

{"abstract":"Falls are one of the major causes leading to injury of elderly people. Using wearable devices for fall detection has a high cost and may cause inconvenience to the daily lives of the elderly. In this paper, we present an automated fall detection approach that requires only a low-cost depth camera. Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects. Experimenting with the dataset shows that our approach can achieve up to 91.15% sensitivity, 77.14% specificity, and 86.83% accuracy. On a public dataset, our approach performs comparably to state-of-the-art fall detection methods that need multiple cameras.

{"abstract":"Intelligent Transportation Systems rely on understanding, predicting and affecting the interactions between vehicles. Development of such systems must be based upon data derived from actual interactions if they are to be effective when used in real world applications. Increasingly, systems are being developed that are based on radio communication of state and intent between vehicles. Understanding of how these interactions occur is also necessary to creating robust systems. In order to test and compare new techniques, approaches and algorithms it is necessary to have a rich dataset to experiment with. This paper presents a detailed dataset useful for members of the Intelligent Transportation Systems community. It contains vehicle state information, vehicle-to-vehicle communications and road maps at high temporal resolution for large numbers of interacting vehicles over a long time period. This data set has already been used for a number of Intelligent Transportation Systems projects such as road mapping, driver intent prediction and collision avoidance among others.

{"abstract":"The use of virtual environments with head-mounted displays (HMDs) offers unique assets to the evaluation and therapy of clinical populations. However, research examining the effects of this technology on clinical populations is sparse. Understanding how wearers interact with the HMD is vital. Discomfort leads to altered use of the HMD that could confound performance measures; the very measures which might be used as tools for clinical decision making. The current study is a post-hoc analysis of the relationship between HMD use and HMD comfort. The analysis was conducted to examine contributing factors for a high incidence of simulator sickness observed in an HMD-based driving simulator. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate objective and subjective measures of HMD performance and self-reported user comfort ratings. The results indicated weak correlations between these variables, indicating the complexity of quantifying user discomfort and HMD performance. Comparison of two case studies detailing user behavior in the virtual environment demonstrates that selected variables may not capture how individuals use the HMD. The validity and usefulness of the HMD-based virtual environments must be understood to fully reap the benefits of virtual reality (VR) in rehabilitation medicine. Language: en","authors":["Lisa K.

{"abstract":"We analyzed age-related changes in motor response in a visuomotor compensatory tracking task. Subjects used a manipulandum to attempt to keep a displayed cursor at the center of a screen despite random perturbations to its location. Cross-correlation analysis of the perturbation and the subject response showed no age-related increase in latency until the onset of response to the perturbation, but substantial slowing of the response itself. Results are consistent with age-related deterioration in the ratio of signal to noise in visuomotor response. The task is such that it is tractable to use Bayesian and quadratic optimality assumptions to construct a model for behavior. This model assumes that behavior resembles an optimal controller subject to noise, and parametrizes response in terms of latency, willingness to expend effort, noise intensity, and noise bandwidth. The model is consistent with the data for all young (n = 12, age 20-30) and most elderly (n = 12, age 65-92) subjects. The model reproduces the latency result from the cross-correlation method. When presented with increased noise, the computational model reproduces the experimentally observed age-related slowing and the observed lack of increased latency. The model provides a precise way to quantitatively formulate the long-standing hypothesis that age-related slowing is an adaptation to increased noise.

{"abstract":"Here, we develop a theory of the relationship between the reviewer's effort and bias in peer review. From this theory, it follows that journal editors might employ biased reviewers because they shirk less. This creates an incentive for the editor to use monitoring mechanisms (e.g., associate editors supervising the peer review process) that mitigate the resulting bias in the reviewers' recommendations. The supervision of associate editors could encourage journal editors to employ more extreme reviewers. This theory helps to explain the presence of bias in peer review. To mitigate shirking by a reviewer, the journal editor may assign biased referees to generate information about the manuscript's quality and subject the reviewer's recommendations to supervision by a more aligned associate editor.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate asymmetrical interactions between humans and their environment using online seat booking sites. BACKGROUND: Functional differences between the cerebral hemispheres affect the choices people make. For example, when asked to imagine going to a cinema, people preferentially select seats to the right We investigated whether this experimental research generalizes to online booking sites for aircraft and theaters. METHOD: Occupancy rates for seats taken on the left and right sides were assessed for 100 airline flights with 12,762 available seats and 37 theater performances with 34,456 seats. On the basis of previous research, a rightward bias was predicted for aircraft and theaters. RESULTS: For aircraft, contrary to expectation, occupancy rate was higher for left- compared with right-side seats. For theaters, a rightward bias was observed when the theater was less than half full.The bias was not affected by the orientation of the map. CONCLUSION: For aircraft, the leftward preference could be attributable to a rightward turning bias or a \"feeling\" that the port seats are closer to the exit, even though they are not. For theaters, the data demonstrate that the rightward preference observed in earlier studies exists only when the theater is relatively empty. APPLICATION: Asymmetrical seating may play an important role in the efficient assimilation of information from the environment, and this role should take this into account when designing effective human-environment interfaces.The online method of assessing seating used in the current study provides an informative and potentially powerful means of assessing asymmetries in human perception and action.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This investigation sought to develop a reliable and valid classification system for identifying and classifying the underlying causes of pilot errors reported under the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). BACKGROUND: ASAP is a voluntary safety program that air carriers may establish to study pilot and crew performance on the line. In ASAP programs, similar to the Aviation Safety Reporting System, pilots self-report incidents by filing a short text description of the event. The identification of contributors to errors is critical if organizations are to improve human performance, yet it is difficult for analysts to extract this information from text narratives. A taxonomy was needed that could be used by pilots to classify the causes of errors. METHOD: After completing a thorough literature review, pilot interviews and a card-sorting task were conducted in Studies 1 and 2 to develop the initial structure of the Aviation Causal Contributors for Event Reporting Systems (ACCERS) taxonomy. The reliability and utility of ACCERS was then tested in studies 3a and 3b by having pilots independently classify the primary and secondary causes of ASAP reports. RESULTS: The results provided initial evidence for the internal and external validity of ACCERS. Pilots were found to demonstrate adequate levels of agreement with respect to their category classifications. CONCLUSIONS: ACCERS appears to be a useful system for studying human error captured under pilot ASAP reports. Future work should focus on how ACCERS is organized and whether it can be used or modified to classify human error in ASAP programs for other aviation-related job categories such as dispatchers. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include systems in which individuals self-report errors and that attempt to extract and classify the causes of those events.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate if a verbal task can improve alertness and if performance changes are associated with changes in alertness as measured by EEG. BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that a secondary task can improve performance on a short, monotonous drive. The current work extends this by examining longer, fatiguing drives. The study also uses EEG to confirm that improved driving performance is concurrent with improved driver alertness. METHOD: A 90-min, monotonous simulator drive was used to place drivers in a fatigued state. Four secondary tasks were used: no verbal task, continuous verbal task, late verbal task, and a passive radio task. RESULTS: When engaged in a secondary verbal task at the end of the drive, drivers showed improved lane-keeping performance and had improvements in neurophysiological measures of alertness. CONCLUSION: A strategically timed concurrent task can improve performance even for fatiguing drives.

{"abstract":"We examined errors in the localization of nearby virtual objects presented via see-through helmet-mounted displays as a function of viewing conditions and scene content in four experiments using a total of 38 participants. Monocular, biocular, and stereoscopic presentation of the virtual objects, accommodation (required focus), participants' age, and the position of physical surfaces were examined. Nearby physical surfaces were found to introduce localization errors that differ depending on the other experimental factors. These errors apparently arise from the occlusion of the physical background by the optically superimposed virtual objects, but they are modified by participants' accommodative competence and specific viewing conditions. The apparent physical size and transparency of the virtual objects and physical surfaces, respectively, are influenced by their relative position when superimposed. The design implications of the findings are discussed in a concluding section. Head-mounted displays of virtual objects are currently being evaluated as aids for mechanical assembly and equipment maintenance. Other applications include telesurgery, surgical planning, telerobotics, and visualization aids for robotic programming. Language: en","authors":["Stephen R. Ellis","Brian M.

{"abstract":"A new procedure for evaluating symbol comprehension, the phrase generation procedure, was assessed with 52 younger and 52 older adults. Participants generated as many phrases as came to mind when viewing 40 different safety symbols (hazard alerting, mandatory action, prohibition, and information symbols). Symbol familiarity was also assessed. Comprehension rates for both groups were lower than the 85% level recommended by the American National Standards Institute. Moreover, older participants' comprehension was significantly worse than younger participants', and the older adults also generated significantly fewer phrases. Generally, prohibition symbols were comprehended best and hazard alerting symbols worst. In addition, symbol familiarity was positively correlated with symbol comprehension. These findings indicate that important safety information depicted on signs and household products may be misunderstood if presented in symbolic form. Furthermore, certain types of symbols may be better understood (e.g., prohibition symbols) than other types (e.g., hazard alerting symbols) by both younger and older individuals. These findings signify the utility of the phrase generation procedure as a method for evaluating symbol comprehension, particularly when it is not possible or desirable to provide contextual information. Actual or potential applications of this research include using the phrase generation approach to identify poorly comprehended symbols, including identification of critical confusions that may arise when processing symbolic information.

{"abstract":"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), a signature wound of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, can result from blunt head trauma or exposure to a blast\/explosion. While TBI affects sleep, the neurobiological underpinnings between TBI and sleep are largely unknown. To examine the neurobiological underpinnings of this relationship in military veterans, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) was used to compare mTBI-related changes in relative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) during wakefulness, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep, after adjusting for the effects of posttraumatic stress (PTS). Fourteen Veterans with a history of Blast Exposure and\/or mTBI (B\/mTBI) (age 27.5\u00b13.9) and eleven Veterans with no history (No B\/mTBI) (age 27.7\u00b13.8) completed FDG PET studies during wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM sleep. Whole-brain analyses were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Between group comparisons revealed that B\/mTBI was associated with significantly lower rCMRglc during wakefulness and REM sleep in the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, insula, uncus, culmen, visual association cortices, and midline medial frontal cortices. These results suggest alterations in neurobiological networks during Wakefulness and REM sleep subsequent to B\/mTBI exposure, may contribute to chronic sleep disturbances, and differ in individuals with acute symptoms.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study addressed the role of familiarization on a driving simulator with a forward collision warning (FCW) and investigated its impact on driver behavior. BACKGROUND: Drivers need a good understanding of how an FCW system functions to trust it and use it properly. Theoretical and empirical data suggest that exploring the capacities and limitations of the FCW during the learning period improves operating knowledge and leads to increased driver trust in the system and better driver-system interactions.The authors tested this hypothesis by comparing groups of drivers differing in FCW familiarity. METHOD: During the familiarization phase, familiarized drivers were trained on the simulator using the FCW, unfamiliarized drivers simply read an FCW manual, and control drivers had no contact with the FCW. During the test, drivers drove the simulator and had to interact with traffic; both familiarized and unfamiliarized drivers used the FCW, whereas controls did not. RESULTS: Simulator familiarization improved driver understanding of FCW operation. Driver-system interactions were more effective: Familiarized drivers had no collisions, longer time headways, and better reactions in most situations. Familiarization increased trust in the FCW but did not raise system acceptance. CONCLUSION: Familiarization on the simulator had a positive effect on driver-system interactions and on trust in the system. The limitations of the familiarization method are discussed in relation to the driving simulator methodology. APPLICATION: Practicing on a driving simulator with driving-assistance systems could facilitate their use during real driving.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The impact of interference from irrelevant spatial versus verbal cues is investigated in an auditory spatial Stroop task, and individual differences in navigation strategy are examined as a moderating factor. BACKGROUND: Verbal-spatial cue conflict in the auditory modality has not been extensively studied, and yet the potential for such conflict can be high in certain settings, such as modern aircraft and automobile cockpits, where multiple warning systems and verbally delivered instructions may compete for the operator's spatial attention. METHOD: Two studies are presented in which participants responded to either the semantic meaning or the spatial location of directional words, which were presented from congruent and incongruent locations. A subset was selected from the larger sample for additional analyses based on their navigation strategy. RESULTS: Results demonstrated greater interference when participants were responding to the spatial location and thus attempting to ignore conflicting semantic information. Participants with a verbal navigation strategy paralleled this finding. Conversely, highly spatial navigators responded faster to spatially relevant information but did not show corresponding interference when trying to ignore spatial information. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that people have fundamentally different approaches to the use of auditory spatial information that manifest at the early level of orienting toward a single word or sound. APPLICATION: When designing spatial information displays and warning systems, particularly those with an auditory component, designers should ensure that either verbal-directional or nonverbal-spatial information is utilized by all alerts to reduce interference.

{"abstract":"The goals of this study were to (a) examine the phenomenology and developmental correlates of problematic Internet use (PIU) in a large and diverse college student sample; (b) evaluate a developmental process model of PIU in which the expected association between child maltreatment and PIU would be explained by alexithymia; and (c) explore these relations as a function of gender and race. PIU was assessed in a sample of 1,470 college students (62.9 percent female, 37.1 percent male; M(age)=19.13 years [SD=1.49]; 46.1 percent Asian, 28.2 percent Hispanic, 16.3 percent White, 5.9 percent Black, and 3.5 percent Multiracial\/Other) who participated in a larger study of young adult adaptation, which included measures of child maltreatment, alexithymia, self-concept, social support, and psychopathology. Males and Asian students endorsed higher levels of PIU than females and other ethnoracial groups, respectively. PIU was related to contemporaneous maladaptation in the form of decreased self-concept, lower social support, and increased psychopathology across groups. Experiences of child maltreatment were related to increased PIU, and mediation analyses showed that this relation was partially explained by alexithymia. These relations were comparable across males and females and between Asian and non-Asian respondents. The analyses provide evidence for the significant role of child maltreatment and the cognitive-affective deficits it precipitates in understanding pathways toward PIU in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that maltreated youth are at disproportionate risk for PIU, and their capacities to regulate and process emotion are important targets for prevention and therapeutic intervention.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: An empirical investigation was done to determine if there are age-related differences attributable to costs in reliance on a decision aid. BACKGROUND: Costs of reliance on a decision aid may affect reliance on the aid. Older and younger adults may not perceive and respond to a dynamic cost structure equally or objectively. METHOD: Sixteen older adults (65-74 years) and 16 younger adults (18-28 years) performed a counting task with an imperfect decision aid. Two types of costs were manipulated: (a) cost of error (CoE) and (b) cost of verification (CoV). The percentage of trials in which participants agreed with the decision aid and did not perform the task manually was recorded as reliance. Results: Participants decreased their reliance as the CoE increased and increased their reliance with a lower CoV; however, they tended to underrely on the decision aid. Younger adults tended to change their reliance behavior more than older adults did with the changing cost structure. CONCLUSIONS: Older and younger adults appear to interpret costs differently, with older adults being less responsive to changes in costs. Older adults may have been less able to monitor the changing costs and hence not adapt to them as well as younger adults. APPLICATION: Designers of decision aids should consider explicitly stating costs associated with reliance on the aid, as individuals may differ in how they interpret and respond to changing costs.

{"abstract":"One of the main factors in all aviation accidents is human error. Therefore, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) has identified several human factors safety technologies to address this problem. Some technologies directly address human error either by attempting to reduce the occurrence of errors or by mitigating the negative consequences of errors. However, new technologies and system changes may also introduce new error opportunities or even induce different types of errors. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the relationship between error classes and technology \"fixes\" is crucial for the evaluation of intervention strategies outlined in the AvSP so that resources can be effectively directed to maximize the benefit to flight safety. This article summarizes efforts to map intervention technologies onto error categories and describes creation of a conceptual framework, identification of applicable taxonomies for each dimension of the framework, and construction of a usable prototype database. The framework consists of a three-dimensional matrix with axes for the human operator, the task, and the environment. Human errors and technologies cohabit molecules in the matrix linking them. The database allows for taxonomic development in all three areas pertaining to human performance by keeping the taxonomies dynamic. Language: en","authors":["Esa M. Rantanen","Brent O.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to show how driver attention to the road scene and engagement of a choice of secondary tasks are affected by the level of automation provided to assist or take over the basic task of vehicle control. It was also designed to investigate the difference between support in longitudinal control and support in lateral control. BACKGROUND: There is comparatively little literature on the implications of automation for drivers' engagement in the driving task and for their willingness to engage in non-driving-related activities. METHOD: A study was carried out on a high-level driving simulator in which drivers experienced three levels of automation: manual driving, semiautomated driving with either longitudinal or lateral control provided, and highly automated driving with both longitudinal and lateral control provided. Drivers were free to pay attention to the roadway and traffic or to engage in a range of entertainment and grooming tasks. RESULTS: Engagement in the nondriving tasks increased from manual to semiautomated driving and increased further with highly automated driving. There were substantial differences in attention to the road and traffic between the two types of semiautomated driving. CONCLUSION: The literature on automation and the various task analyses of driving do not currently help to explain the effects that were found. Lateral support and longitudinal support may be the same in terms of levels of automation but appear to be regarded rather differently by drivers.

The integrated dataset is used to explore connections between the built environment and driving behavior, specifically between business concentration, driving speed, vehicle stops and rear-end crashes. Driving speed, an important determinant of driver behavior linked to traffic safety, is found to be inversely related to business concentration, a pattern that does not vary by time of day.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A prototype interface was developed to support decision making during tactical operations; a laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the capability of this interface to support a critical activity (i.e., obtaining the status of friendly combat resources). BACKGROUND: Effective interface design strategies have been developed for domains that have primarily law-driven (e.g., process control) or intent-driven (e.g., information retrieval) constraints. However, design strategies for intermediate domains in which both types of constraints are equally critical, such as military command and control, have not been explored as extensively. The principles of direct perception, direct manipulation, and perception-action loops were used to develop a hybrid interface design strategy (\"perception-action icons\") that was incorporated into the prototype interface. METHODS: A qualitative tactical simulation and an alternative interface (an experimental version of an existing U.S. Army interface) were developed. Participants used both interfaces to provide estimates of friendly combat resources for three different categories of information at three different echelon levels. RESULTS: The results were unequivocal, indicating that the interface with perception-action icons produced significantly better performance. CONCLUSION: The perception-action icon design strategy was very effective in this experimental context. The potential for this design strategy to be useful for other intermediate domains is explored.

{"abstract":"While much research has elucidated the neurobiology of fear learning, the neural systems supporting the generalization of learned fear are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that regions involved in the acquisition of fear support the generalization of fear to stimuli that are similar to a learned threat, but vary in fear intensity value. Behaviorally, subjects retrospectively misidentified a learned threat as a more intense stimulus and expressed greater skin conductance responses (SCR) to generalized stimuli of high intensity. Brain activity related to intensity-based fear generalization was observed in the striatum, insula, thalamus\/ periacqueductal gray, and subgenual cingulate cortex. The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity, and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings reveal the brain regions and functional networks involved in flexibly responding to stimuli that resemble a learned threat. These regions may comprise an intensity-based fear generalization circuit that underlies retrospective biases in threat value estimation and overgeneralization of fear in anxiety disorders. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: \u25baBrain regions involved in aversive learning flexibly respond to generalized threats. \u25baGeneralization is marked by individual differences in psychophysiological arousal. \u25baAmygdala activity positively correlates with behavioral measures of generalization. \u25baFear generalization is associated with increases in amygdala-fusiform connectivity.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to examine the influence of implicit attitudes toward automation on users' trust in automation. BACKGROUND: Past empirical work has examined explicit (conscious) influences on user level of trust in automation but has not yet measured implicit influences. We examine concurrent effects of explicit propensity to trust machines and implicit attitudes toward automation on trust in an automated system. We examine differential impacts of each under varying automation performance conditions (clearly good, ambiguous, clearly poor). METHOD: Participants completed both a self-report measure of propensity to trust and an Implicit Association Test measuring implicit attitude toward automation, then performed an X-ray screening task. Automation performance was manipulated within-subjects by varying the number and obviousness of errors. RESULTS: Explicit propensity to trust and implicit attitude toward automation did not significantly correlate. When the automation's performance was ambiguous, implicit attitude significantly affected automation trust, and its relationship with propensity to trust was additive: Increments in either were related to increases in trust. When errors were obvious, a significant interaction between the implicit and explicit measures was found, with those high in both having higher trust. CONCLUSION: Implicit attitudes have important implications for automation trust. APPLICATION: Users may not be able to accurately report why they experience a given level of trust. To understand why users trust or fail to trust automation, measurements of implicit and explicit predictors may be necessary.

We evaluated tracking precision by calculating the mean spatial deviation from the target for each session. RESULTS: Tracking precision was significantly influenced by the interaction between shift and session, suggesting a clear time-of-day effect of visuomotor performance under real-life conditions. Tracking performance declined during early-morning hours whereas fatigue ratings increased. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that our setup is suitable to detect time-of-day dependent performance changes in visually guided tracking. APPLICATION: Our task could be used to evaluate fluctuations in visuomotor coordination, a skill that is decisive in various production steps at the actual working place to assess productivity.

{"abstract":"The objective of this study was to test the effect of individual differences on appeal and use of video games. Participants were 299 adolescent boys from lower and higher secondary schools in the Netherlands and Belgium. In general, boys were most attracted to violent video games. Boys that scored higher in trait aggressiveness and lower in empathy were especially attracted to violent games and spent more time playing video games than did boys lower in trait aggressiveness. Lower educated boys showed more appreciation for both violent and nonviolent games and spent more time playing them than did higher educated boys. The present study showed that aggressive and less empathic boys were most attracted to violent games. The fact that heavy users of violent games show less empathy and higher aggressiveness suggests the possibility of desensitization. Other studies have shown that playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy. These results combined suggest the possibility of a violence cycle. Aggressive individuals are attracted to violent games. Playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy, which in turn leads to increased appreciation and use of violent games.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of age, gender, and target location upon arm reach capacity and posture. BACKGROUND: The older adult population is growing in number. Their specific needs must be better understood to improve the design of work and life spaces. METHOD: Thirty-eight adults, divided into four groups according to their gender and age, participated in the experiment. They were asked to reach 84 targets located in a large space defined according to their anthropometry and reach capacities. Reach capacities and postures were analyzed. RESULTS: On average, older participants showed shorter maximal reach distances (by 4.8% of upper limb length) as compared with younger participants. No gender difference was found for maximum reach distance. Age also had significant effects on reach posture, especially through its interactions with target azimuth. Older participants tended to use their trunk less whenever possible. Reduced neck and trunk\/seat axial rotations were observed for the older participants when the target deviated from the sagittal plane. They compensated by a greater rotation of the pelvis with respect to the seat. CONCLUSION: Older people's reach capacities should be taken as references, rather than those of younger people, in order to accommodate a wider range of the population. APPLICATION: These results can be used to improve the arrangement of living spaces and work spaces for older people.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examines recent trends and patterns in fall fatalities in the U.S. construction industry to determine whether fatal falls among older workers are different from younger workers in this industry. BACKGROUND: Falls are the leading cause of fatalities in the U.S. construction industry. Given the increasingly aging workforce in construction, it is important to assess the risk of falls among older construction workers. METHODS: Fatality data were obtained from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries for the years 1992 through 2008. Denominators for death rates were estimated from the Current Population Survey. Stratified and multivariate analyses were performed to examine whether there are differences in fatal falls between older workers (> or = 55 years) and younger workers (16-54 years). Fatal falls in nonconstruction industries were excluded from this study. RESULTS: Older workers had higher rates of fatal falls than younger workers; results were significant in 11 of 14 construction occupations. Regression analysis indicated that older decedents had a higher likelihood that work-related death was caused by a fall, after controlling for major demographic and employment factors (odds ratio = 1.50, confidence interval [1.30, 1.72]). Falls from roofs accounted for one third of construction fatal falls, but falls from ladders caused a larger proportion of deadly falls in older decedents than in younger decedents. CONCLUSION: Older workers have a higher likelihood of dying from a fall. Roofs and ladders are particularly risky for older construction workers. APPLICATION: As the construction workforce ages, there is an urgent need to enhance fall prevention efforts, provide work accommodations, and match work capabilities to job duties.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that automation errors on tasks easily performed by humans undermine trust in automation. BACKGROUND: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. METHOD: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). RESULTS: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects. CONCLUSION: Automation errors on tasks that appear \"easy\" to the operator severely degrade trust and reliance.

{"abstract":"INTRODUCTION: A recent meta-analysis by Hedman et al. allows for accurate estimation of brain volume changes throughout the life span. Additionally, Tate et al. showed that intracranial volume at a later point in life can be used to estimate reliably brain volume at an earlier point in life. These advancements were combined to create a model which allowed the estimation of brain volume just prior to injury in a group of patients with mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). This volume estimation model was used in combination with actual measurements of brain volume to test hypotheses about progressive brain atrophy in the patients. METHODS: Twenty six patients with mild or moderate TBI were compared to 20 normal control subjects. NeuroQuant\u00ae was used to measure brain MRI volume. Brain volume after the injury (from MRI scans performed at t1 and t2) was compared to brain volume just before the injury (volume estimation at t0) using longitudinal designs. Groups were compared with respect to volume changes in whole brain parenchyma (WBP) and its 3 major subdivisions: cortical gray matter (GM), cerebral white matter (CWM) and subcortical nuclei+infratentorial regions (SCN+IFT). RESULTS: Using the normal control data, the volume estimation model was tested by comparing measured brain volume to estimated brain volume; reliability ranged from good to excellent. During the initial phase after injury (t0-t1), the TBI patients had abnormally rapid atrophy of WBP and CWM, and abnormally rapid enlargement of SCN+IFT. Rates of volume change during t0-t1 correlated with cross-sectional measures of volume change at t1, supporting the internal reliability of the volume estimation model. A logistic regression analysis using the volume change data produced a function which perfectly predicted group membership (TBI patients vs. normal control subjects). CONCLUSIONS: During the first few months after injury, patients with mild or moderate TBI have rapid atrophy of WBP and CWM, and rapid enlargement of SCN+IFT. The magnitude and pattern of the changes in volume may allow for the eventual development of diagnostic tools based on the volume estimation approach. Language: en","authors":["David E.

{"abstract":"Human factors research and debate related to mental workload have been going on for decades since the 60's (McKenzie et al. 1966) and is still happening (Finomore et al. 2013). The raised issues are: is it useful (\"do we need the concept of mental workload or do we have to banish it for good?\" Leplat 2002), is it scientifically credible (Dekker et al. 2010), and, in case of a positive answer, how to measure it (Jex 1988). In the context of the driving task, human factors research is abundant and diversified, aiming at a better understanding of driver behavior and functional capacities in terms of perception, cognition, and motor processes in order to improve road safety (Lee 2008), drivers' mental workload being an important issue to consider in this framework (Dick de Waard 1996). This problematic is even more crucial since the deployment of onboard Intelligent Transport System in the vehicles (Carsten and Nilsson 2001), as human factors have the responsibility to evaluate whether these innovative systems really support the driving task or, on the contrary, lead to distraction and increase mental workload, with potential dramatic consequences in terms of road safety. So, since the beginning of research in this area, the objectives have been to establish methods of assessing fluctuations in mental workload that are sensitive to the various aspects of attentional processing requirements in relation to both external environmental conditions, such as traffic density as well as in-vehicle conditions, such as competing visual and auditory displays (Pauzie\u00b4 and Amditis 2010). Workload can be defined as a hypothetical construct that represents the cost incurred by a human operator to achieve a particular level of performance (Hart 1986). Driving performance and the driver's mental workload are both relevant and complementary parameters to consider, knowing that they can vary independently (Yeh and Wickens 1988). Indeed, if the complexity of the task increases, the driver is able to maintain a stable performance to a certain degree, by increasing effort.

{"abstract":"Two crucial processes preceding voluntary action are determining the time for movement initiation and planning of the specific sequence of motor output. In this study we aimed to differentiate the neural activity related to motor timing and motor sequencing and to examine over what time periods they contribute to premovement activity during the readiness for voluntary action. 18 participants performed self-initiated voluntary finger movements in a readiness potential paradigm, both during EEG measurement and during fMRI. The finger movement task involved three conditions: 1) simple repetitive sequences; 2) increased demand on the sequencing of movement order; and 3) increased demand on the timing of movement initiation. Functional MRI and 64 channels EEG were conducted in two separate sessions. Motor timing and motor sequencing were found to involve different neural processes occurring at different times prior to movement initiation. Motor timing involved greater activation in lateral prefrontal regions over the earliest part of premovement activity, from 1200ms before movement onset. Motor sequencing involved greater activation of dorsal premotor and parietal areas and was reflected in central and parietal scalp regions only over the later part of premovement activity, within 600 ms of movement onset. We suggest that different neural processes contribute to different aspects of the intended action over different time periods during the preparation for movement, and it is the co-ordinated activity of these multiple regions that is represented in premovement activity during the readiness for voluntary action.

{"abstract":"Thirty-six ethical codes from national professional associations were studied, the aim to test whether librarians have global shared values or if political and cultural contexts have significantly influenced the codes' content. Gorman's eight core values of stewardship, service, intellectual freedom, rationalism, literacy and learning, equity of access to recorded knowledge and information, privacy and democracy were used as a benchmark. A quantitative analysis was carried out of which values each code contained. The codes were further qualitatively analysed, to examine how each value was expressed. It was found that on average codes featured five of Gorman's eight values. The most popular values were: service, privacy, equity of access, stewardship and intellectual freedom. The least popular value was rationalism, across all codes. Some codes omitted certain values because of their specific focus, such as the Native American code. Codes varied in how values were expressed, for example some codes limited principles by law, while some did not. Expression of stewardship and democracy was found to be stronger in countries which have recently experienced conflict or colonialism. The relationship between the profession and the state was another area of variation. Countries in the Asia-Pacific put more emphasis on the power of the State.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of the situation present assessment method (SPAM) affects workload and\/or task performance. BACKGROUND: SPAM probes are thought to isolate workload from the assessment of situation awareness (SA) by including a warning signal before asking an SA-related question. However, there is a good reason to think that SPAM may still have an effect on dynamic workload and task performance. Specifically, nearly all dual tasks affect workload and performance; thus, it would be surprising if SPAM did not. METHOD: Following the methods of Durso, Bleckley, and Dattel, I evaluated workload and performance on the Air Traffic Scenarios Test in SPAM, non-SPAM probe, and no-probe conditions. RESULTS: Global workload was unaffected by probe administration. However, at least with novice performers, SPAM probes affected task performance. CONCLUSION: The use of a warning signal does not eliminate performance decrements associated with secondary tasks. Moreover, there may be performance decrements unique to SPAM. APPLICATION: Cautious users of online assessment measures, such as SPAM, may want to remove performance immediately subsequent to probes from analysis, use an interprobe interval longer than 2.83 min, and construct their assessment measures to reduce display search times unrelated to primary task performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore how a single master alarm system affects drivers' responses when compared with multiple, distinct warnings. BACKGROUND: Advanced driver warning systems are intended to improve safety, yet inappropriate integration may increase the complexity of driving, especially in high workload situations. This study investigated the effects of auditory alarm scheme, reliability, and collision event type on driver performance. METHOD: Using a 2 x 2 x 4 mixed factorial design, we investigated the impact of two alarm schemes (master vs. individual) and two levels of alarm reliability (high and low) on distracted drivers' performance across four collision event types (frontal collision warnings, left and right lane departure warnings, and warnings for a fast-approaching following vehicle). RESULTS: Participants' reaction times and accuracy rates were significantly affected by the type of collision event and alarm reliability. The use of individual alarms, rather than a single master alarm, did not significantly affect driving performance in terms of reaction time or response accuracy. CONCLUSION: Even though a master alarm is a relatively uninformative warning, it produced statistically no different reaction times or accuracy results when compared with information-rich auditory icons, some of which were spatially located. In addition, unreliable alarms negatively impacted driver performance, regardless of event type or alarm scheme.

{"abstract":"In relation to a sample of 1,092 Italian adolescents (50.9% females), the present study aims to: (a) analyze the most parsimonious structure of the cyberbullying and cybervictimization construct in male and female Italian adolescents through confirmatory factor analysis; and (b) analyze the severity and the discrimination parameters of each act using the item response theory. Results showed that the structure of the cyberbullying scale for perpetrated and received behaviors in both genders could best be represented by a monodimensional model where each item lies on a continuum of severity of aggressive acts. For both genders, the less severe acts are silent\/prank calls and insults on instant messaging, and the most severe acts are unpleasant pictures\/photos on Web sites, phone pictures\/photos\/videos of intimate scenes, and phone pictures\/photos\/videos of violent scenes. The items nasty text messages, nasty or rude e-mails, insults on Web sites, insults in chatrooms, and insults on blogs range from moderate to high levels of severity. Regarding the discrimination level of the acts, several items emerged as good indicators at various levels of cyberbullying and cybervictimization severity, with the exception of silent\/prank calls. Furthermore, gender specificities underlined that the visual items can be considered good indicators of severe cyberbullies and cybervictims only in males. This information can help in understanding better the nature of the phenomenon, its severity in a given population, and to plan more specific prevention and intervention strategies.

{"abstract":"Networks often possess mesoscale structures, and studying them can yield insights into both structure and function. It is most common to study community structure, but numerous other types of mesoscale structures also exist. In this paper, we examine core-periphery structures based on both density and transport. In such structures, core network components are well-connected both among themselves and to peripheral components, which are not well-connected to anything. We examine core-periphery structures in a wide range of examples of transportation, social, and financial networks-including road networks in large urban areas, a rabbit warren, a dolphin social network, a European interbank network, and a migration network between counties in the United States. We illustrate that a recently developed transport-based notion of node coreness is very useful for characterizing transportation networks. We also generalize this notion to examine core versus peripheral edges, and we show that the resulting diagnostic is also useful for transportation networks. To examine the properties of transportation networks further, we develop a family of generative models of roadlike networks. We illustrate the effect of the dimensionality of the embedding space on transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the correlations between different measures of coreness can be very different for different types of networks.

{"abstract":"An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of an in-vehicle collision avoidance warning system (IVCAWS) on driver performance. A driving simulator was driven by 135 licensed drivers. Of these, 120 received alerts from the IVCAWS when their headway to a lead car was less than 2 s, and the other 15 (the control group) received no alerts. Drivers received varied alert interfaces: auditory, visual, and multimodal. The system had varied levels of reliability, determined by both false alarm rate and failure of the IVCAWS to alert to short headway. Results indicated that the IVCAWS led to safer (longer) headway maintenance. High false alarm rates induced drivers to slow down unnecessarily; large numbers of missed alerts did not have any significant impact on drivers. Driver acceptance of the system was mixed. Interface played a role in driver reliance on the system, with the multimodal interfaces generating least reliance. Actual or potential applications of this research include IVCAWS interface selection for greater system efficacy and user acceptance and the advisability of implementation, even of imperfect systems, for drivers who seek to maintain a safer headway.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the willingness and ability of general aviation pilots to execute steep approaches in low-visibility conditions into nontowered airports. BACKGROUND: Executing steep approaches in poor weather is required for a proposed Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) that consists of small aircraft flying direct routes to a network of regional airports. METHOD: Across two experiments, 17 pilots rated for Instrument Flight Rules at George Mason University or Virginia Tech flew a Cessna 172R simulator into Blacksburg, Virginia. Pilots were familiarized with the simulator and asked to fly approaches with either a 200- or 400-foot ceiling (at approach angles of 3 degrees, 5 degrees, and 7 degrees in the first experiment, 3 degrees and 6 degrees in the second). Pilots rated subjective workload and the simulator recorded flight parameters for each set of approaches. RESULTS: Approaches with a 5 degree approach angle produced safe landings with minimal deviations from normal descent control configurations and were rated as having a moderate level of workload. Approaches with 6 degree and 7 degree approach angles produced safe landings but high workload ratings. Pilots reduced power to control the speed of descent and flew the aircraft slightly above the glide path to gain time to control the landing. CONCLUSION: Although the 6 degree and 7 degree approaches may not be practical for routine approaches, they may be achievable in the event of an emergency. APPLICATION: Further work using other aircraft flying under a wider variety of conditions is needed before implementing SATS-type flights into airports intended to supplant or complement commercial operations in larger airports.

{"abstract":"Performing two tasks simultaneously (dual-task) is common in human daily life. The neural correlates of dual-task processing remain unclear. In the current study, we used a dual motor and counting task with functional MRI (fMRI) to determine whether there are any areas additionally activated for dual-task performance. Moreover, we investigated the functional connectivity of these added activated areas, as well as the training effect on brain activity and connectivity. We found that the right cerebellar vermis, left lobule V of the cerebellar anterior lobe and precuneus are additionally activated for this type of dual-tasking. These cerebellar regions had functional connectivity with extensive motor- and cognitive-related regions. Dual-task training induced less activation in several areas, but increased the functional connectivity between these cerebellar regions and numbers of motor- and cognitive-related areas. Our findings demonstrate that some regions within the cerebellum can be additionally activated with dual-task performance. Their role in dual motor and cognitive task processes is likely to integrate motor and cognitive networks, and may be involved in adjusting these networks to be more efficient in order to perform dual-tasking properly. The connectivity of the precuneus differs from the cerebellar regions. A possible role of the precuneus in dual-tasks may be to monitor the operation of active brain networks.

BACKGROUND: Rapidly evolving vehicle automation will likely change cars and trucks more in the next 5 years than the preceding 50, radically redefining what it means to drive. METHOD: This special section includes 10 articles from European and North American researchers reporting simulator and naturalistic driving studies. RESULTS: Little research has considered the consequences of fully automated driving, with most focusing on lane-keeping and speed control systems individually. The studies reveal two underlying design philosophies: automate driving versus support driving. Results of several studies, consistent with previous research in other domains, suggest that the automate philosophy can delay driver responses to incidents in which the driver has to intervene and take control from the automation. Understanding how to orchestrate the transfer or sharing of control between the system and the driver, particularly in critical incidents, emerges as a central challenge. CONCLUSION: Designers should not assume that automation can substitute seamlessly for a human driver, nor can they assume that the driver can safely accommodate the limitations of automation. Designers, policy makers, and researchers must give careful consideration to what role the person should have in highly automated vehicles and how to support the driver if the driver is to be responsible for vehicle control. As in other domains, driving safety increasingly depends on the combined performance of the human and automation, and successful designs will depend on recognizing and supporting the new roles of the driver.

{"abstract":"Although characteristics of traditional bullying participants have been identified and studied for years, research on cyberbullying is limited. The purpose of this study is to expand the literature on cyberbullying with a particular focus on the relationships among cyberbullying characteristics, typical social activities, and more traditional forms of bullying. The typical activities and experiences with traditional bullying and cyberbullying of 52 children ages 11 to 17 were compared to those of 52 matched controls. Children exposed to cyberbullying, whether as a cyberbully, cybervictim, or both (bully\/victim), spent more time on computer-based social activities. Nearly two thirds of cyberbully\/victims were also traditional bully\/victims. While preliminary, results suggest that efforts to prevent cyberbullying may need to focus on patterns of Internet use, amount and type of social activities, and exposure to traditional bullying as risk factors for engaging in cyberbullying.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether part-task training produces better learning and retention than whole-task training of a trench-and-load task performed on a hydraulic excavator simulator. BACKGROUND: For complex perceptual-motor tasks that involve several components and require spatial awareness of the environment, part-task training will be effective if the benefit of being able to focus attention on each component outweighs the cost of integrating the components. We predicted that such would be the case for learning to operate an excavator. METHOD: A part-task training group practiced separate Carrier Positioning, Trenching, and Truck Loading modules, whereas a whole-task training group practiced the Trench and Load module, which combines elements from the other modules. The latter module, involving different scenarios, was performed by both groups immediately after training and following a 2-week retention interval. RESULTS: Production rate on the trench-and-load task was better overall on the retention test than on the immediate test. The part-task group showed improvement on the retention test compared with the immediate test, whereas the whole-task group did not. The part-task group showed higher productivity rates than did the whole-task group on the retention test. CONCLUSION: Part-task training on the excavator simulator results in better skill retention than does whole-task training. The benefit of part-task training is likely to be found for other tasks requiring control of implements in various environments. APPLICATION: Part-task training can result in better retention of complex perceptual-motor skills involving several components, even when immediate transfer to the whole task does not show better performance than whole-task training.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effect of cognitive load on guidance of visual attention. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cognitive load can undermine driving performance, particularly drivers' ability to detect safety-critical events. Cognitive load combined with the loss of exogenous cues, which can occur when the driver briefly glances away from the roadway, may be particularly detrimental. METHOD: In each of two experiments, twelve participants engaged in an auditory task while performing a change detection task. A change blindness paradigm was implemented to mask exogenous cues by periodically blanking the screen in a driving simulator while a change occurred. Performance measures included participants' sensitivity to vehicle changes and confidence in detecting them. RESULTS: Cognitive load uniformly diminished participants' sensitivity and confidence, independent of safety relevance or lack of exogenous cues. Periodic blanking, which simulated glances away from the road-way, undermined change detection to a greater degree than did cognitive load; however, drivers' confidence in their ability to detect changes was diminished more by cognitive load than by periodic blanking. CONCLUSION: Cognitive load and short glances away from the road are additive in their tendency to increase the likelihood of drivers missing safety-critical events. APPLICATION: This study demonstrates the need to consider the combined consequence of cognitive load and brief glances away from the road in the design of emerging in-vehicle devices and the need to provide drivers with better feedback regarding these consequences.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We report an experiment and a theoretical analysis concerning the effects of an exclusively cognitive task, specifically a memory rehearsal task, on driver performance. BACKGROUND: Although recent work on driver distraction has elucidated the sometimes significant effects of cognitive processing on driver performance, these studies have typically mixed cognitive with perceptual and motor processing, making it difficult to isolate the effects of cognitive processing alone. METHOD: We asked participants to drive in a driving simulator during only the rehearsal stage of a serial-recall memory task while we measured their ability to maintain a central lane position and respond to the illumination of a lead vehicle's brake lights. RESULTS: Memory rehearsal significantly affected drivers' steering performance as measured by lateral deviation from lane center, and it also significantly affected drivers' response time to the braking stimulus for the higher load memory task. CONCLUSION: These results lend support to a theoretical account of cognitive distraction provided by threaded cognition theory in terms of a cognitive bottleneck in procedural processing, and they also suggest that consideration of task urgency may be important in accounting for performance trade-offs among concurrent tasks. APPLICATION: The experiment augments the current understanding of cognitive driver distraction and suggests that even exclusively cognitive secondary tasks may sometimes affect driver performance.

{"abstract":"Many heavy crimes committed such as murders or robberies frequently involve firearms, particularly pistols. In order to solve the crime cases, firearm identification is becoming vital. Unique marks are left on the bullet and the cartridge case when a firearm is fired. The firing pin impression is one of the most vital marks on any cartridge case. In this study, a total of 68 features of firing pin impression images - 20 basic statistical features, and 48 geometric moment features up to the sixth order - were extracted from three regions of the firing pin impression image, namely whole, centre and ring images. Five different types of pistol of the Parabellum Vector SPI 9 mm model were tested, where 50 bullets were fired from each pistol. Preliminary analysis using Pearson correlation shows that the features are significantly highly correlated. Therefore principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the interrelationship among the features and combine them into a smaller set of factors while maintaining maximum information of the original patterns. PCA has reduced the dimensionality of the features into nine significant components of features. Discriminant analysis was used to identify the types of pistols used based on the new components. A total of 85.2% of the images were correctly classified according to the pistols used using cross-validation under discriminant analysis. The result demonstrates the potential of using PCA to reduce the dimensions of the numerical features towards an efficient firearm identification system.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: High sensation-seekers (HSS) pursue novelty even at the cost of self-harm. When challenged, HSS are less anxious, show blunted physiological (cortisol, startle) and neurobiological (prefrontal-limbic) responses, and devalue aversive outcomes. Here, we investigate how these features interact under conditions of physical danger, in distinguishing between adaptive and maladaptive approaches to risk. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of individuals who voluntarily sought out recreational exposure to physical risk, and obtained serial cortisol values over two time-locked days. On the 'baseline' day, we scanned subjects' brains with functional and structural MRI; on the 'skydiving day,' subjects completed a first-time tandem skydive. During neuroimaging, subjects viewed cues that predicted aversive noise; neural data were analyzed for prefrontal-limbic reactivity (activation) and regulation (nonlinear complexity), as well as cortical thickness. To probe threat perception, subjects identified aggression for ambiguous faces morphed between neutral and angry poles. RESULTS: Individuals with prefrontal-limbic meso-circuits with less balanced regulation between excitatory and inhibitory components showed both diminished cortisol\/anxiety responses to their skydives, as well as less accurate perceptual recognition of threat. This impaired control was localized to the inferior frontal gyrus, with associated cortical thinning. Structural equation modeling suggests that sensation-seeking is primarily mediated via threat-perception, which itself is primarily mediated via neural reactivity and regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results refine the sensation-seeking construct to provide important distinctions (brain-based, but with endocrine and cognitive consequences) between the brave, who feel fear but nonetheless overcome it, and the reckless, who fail to recognize danger. This distinction has important real-world implications, as those who fail to recognize risk are less likely to mitigate it. Language: en","authors":["Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi","Joshua M.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to present a methodology for computing information relevance. BACKGROUND: Relevance is a pervasive term used in several domains, such as pragmatics, information science, and psychology. Quantifying the relevance of information can be helpful in effective display design. Displays should be designed so that the more relevant information is more easily accessed. METHOD: This procedure focuses on computing the relevance of a piece of information by taking into account three aspects of tasks that use the information: the number of different tasks that make use of the information, the frequency of occurrence of those tasks, and the criticality of those tasks. The methodology can be used to compute the aggregate relevance of a piece of information for a particular component of a system or for the entire system. This methodology was illustrated using the domain of air traffic control (ATC).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possibility of using interactive media to help drowsy drivers wake up, thereby enabling them to drive more safely. BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated the negative impacts of driver drowsiness and distraction in cars, separately. However, none has studied the potentially positive effects of slightly interactive media for rousing drowsy drivers to help them drive more safely. METHOD: In a 2 (drowsy vs. nondrowsy drivers) x 2 (passive vs. slightly interactive voice-based media) x 2 (monotonous vs. varied driving courses) study, participants (N = 79) used a driving simulator while interacting with a language-learning system that was either passive (i.e., drivers merely listen to phrases in another language) or slightly interactive (i.e., drivers verbally repeat those phrases). RESULTS: (a) Drowsy drivers preferred and drove more safely with slightly interactive media, as compared with passive media. (b) Interactive media did not harm nondrowsy driver safety. (c) Drivers drove more safely on varied driving courses than on monotonous ones.

{"abstract":"The perception of causal relationships is crucial to understanding and interacting with our physical and social environment. However, whether the same or different neural processes are involved in perceiving physical and social causality is unknown. Therefore, this study is focused on commonalities and differences in the neural correlates of causality perception in both contexts. During fMRI data-acquisition, participants judged causal relationships of objects in two types of animated video clips (physical\/social) with similar manipulations of temporal and spatial stimulus characteristics. Four conditions were analyzed in a two-factorial design [physical causal (PC), physical non-causal (PNC), social causal (SC), social non-causal (SNC)]. We found that higher angles and longer time delays led to decreasing judgments of causality in the physical context, whereas the same manipulations led to increasing judgments in the social context. Instead of a common network for causal judgments (PC>PNC\u2229SC>SNC), we found a reversed activation pattern for the factors context and judgment. PC and SNC [(PC>PNC)>(SC>SNC)] produced activations in the bilateral insula, the right angular and inferior frontal gyrus and the medial supplementary motor area. PNC and SC [(PC>PNC)SNC)] produced activity in medial frontal, left superior temporal and anterior cingulate brain regions. Our data suggest, that the same brain regions contribute to the impression of physical and social causality. However, they demonstrate a reversed activation pattern that reflects the stimulus characteristics of the respective conditions. Thus, specific stimulus characteristics are crucial for the perception of causality.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A model of semisystematic search was sought that could account for both memory retrieval and other performance-shaping factors. BACKGROUND: Visual search is an important aspect of many examination and monitoring tasks. As a result, visual search performance has been the topic of many empirical investigations. These investigations have reported that individual search performance depends on participant factors such as search behavior, which has motivated the development of models of visual search that incorporate this behavior. Search behavior ranges from random to strictly systematic; variation in behavior is commonly assumed to be caused by differences in memory retrieval and search strategy. METHODS: This model ultimately took the form of a discrete-time nonstationary Markov process. RESULTS: It yields both performance and process measures that include accuracy, time to perception, task time, and coverage while avoiding the statistical difficulties inherent to simulations. In particular, it was seen that as the search behavior becomes more systematic, expected coverage and accuracy increase while expected task time decreases. CONCLUSION: In addition to explaining these outcomes and their interrelationships from a theoretical standpoint, the model can predict these outcomes in practice to a certain extent as it can create an envelope defined by best- and worst-case search performance. APPLICATION: The model also has the capability of supporting assessment. That is, it can be used to assess the effectiveness of an individual's search performance, and to provide possible explanations for this performance, through the use of one or more of the output measures.

{"abstract":"A novel approach is proposed in this paper for automatic forest fire detection from video. Based on 3D point cloud of the collected sample fire pixels, Gaussian mixture model is built and helps segment some possible flame regions in single image. Then the new specific flame pattern is defined for forest, and three types of fire colors are labeled accordingly. With 11 static features including color distributions, texture parameters and shape roundness, the static SVM classifier is trained and filters the segmented results. Using defined overlapping degree and varying degree, the remained candidate regions are matched among consecutive frames. Subsequently the variations of color, texture, roundness, area, contour are computed, then the average and the mean square deviation of them are obtained. Together with the flickering frequency from temporal wavelet based Fourier descriptors analysis of flame contour, 27 dynamic features are used to train the dynamic SVM classifier, which is applied for final decision. Our approach has been tested with dozens of video clips, and it can detect forest fire while recognize the fire like objects, such as red house, bright light and flying flag. Except for the acceptable accuracy, our detection algorithm performs in real time, which proves its value for computer vision based forest fire surveillance.

Researchers evaluated the effects on the head for both correct and incorrect heading techniques. They based the head's geometry on medical images. They determined the injury's magnitude by comparing the neurological tissue's resistance with predictions of the generated stresses. The evaluation examined fast playing conditions in adult soccer, taking into account the ball's speed and the type of impact. Mathematical simulations using the finite element method indicated that correctly heading balls arriving at moderate speed presents a low risk of brain injury. However, damage can happen around the third cervical vertebra. These results coincide with medical studies. Incorrect heading greatly increases the brain injury risk and can alter the parietal area.

Fourteen subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for Simple Phobia\/Accident Phobia and were referred from the emergency department of a general hospital were exposed to a Virtual Driving Environment (Hanyang University Driving Phobia Environment) and computer driving games (London Racer\/Midtown Madness\/Rally Championship). Patients who experienced \"immersion\" (i.e., a sense of presence with heightened anxiety) in one of the driving simulations (defined as an increase in SUD ratings of 3 and\/or an increase of heart rate > 15 BPM in a 1-h trial session of computer simulation driving) were exposed to a cognitive behavioral program of up to 12 1-h sessions involving graded driving simulation tasks with self-monitoring, physiological feedback, diaphragmatic breathing and cognitive reappraisal. Subjects were assessed at the beginning and end of therapy with measurements of: physiological responsivity (heart rate), subjective ratings of distress (SUD), rating scales for severity of fear of driving (FDI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CAPS) and depression (HAM-D) and achievement of target behaviors. Of all patients 7\/14 (50%) became immersed in the driving environments. This immersed group (n = 7) completed the exposure program. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons showed significant post treatment reductions on all measures SUDS (p = 0.008), FDI (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HR (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HAM-D (p = 0.031). Further analysis of the FDI showed significant reductions in all three subscales: travel distress (p = 0.008), travel avoidance (p = 0.008), and maladaptive driving strategies (p = 0.016). The findings of this study suggest that VR and GR may have a useful role in the treatment of driving phobia post-accident even when co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are present.

{"abstract":"White matter (WM) continues to mature through adolescence in parallel with gains in cognitive ability. To date, developmental changes in human WM microstructure have been inferred using analyses of cross-sectional or two time-point follow-up studies, limiting our understanding of individual developmental trajectories. The aims of the present longitudinal study were to characterize the timing of WM growth and investigate how sex and behavior are associated with different developmental trajectories. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 128 individuals ages 8-28, who received annual scans for up to 5 years and completed motor and cognitive tasks. Flexible nonlinear growth curves indicated a hierarchical pattern of WM development. By late childhood, posterior cortical-subcortical connections were similar to adults. During adolescence, WM microstructure reached adult levels, including frontocortical, frontosubcortical and cerebellar connections. Later to mature in adulthood were major corticolimbic association tracts and connections at terminal gray matter sites in cortical and basal ganglia regions. These patterns may reflect adolescent maturation of frontal connectivity supporting cognitive abilities, particularly the protracted refinement of corticolimbic connectivity underlying cognition-emotion interactions. Sex and behavior also played a large role. Males showed continuous WM growth from childhood through early adulthood, whereas females mainly showed growth during mid-adolescence. Further, earlier WM growth in adolescence was associated with faster and more efficient responding and better inhibitory control whereas later growth in adulthood was associated with poorer performance, suggesting that the timing of WM growth is important for cognitive development.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible supervisory control via delegation to automation. BACKGROUND: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. METHOD: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to \"adaptable\") automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a \"level of automation\" as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook is described. RESULTS: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team's \"playbook.\" Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. CONCLUSION: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. APPLICATION: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example for uninhabited air vehicle mission planning.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator was used to compare the effectiveness of increasing intensity (looming) auditory warning signals with other types of auditory warnings. BACKGROUND: Auditory warnings have been shown to speed driver reaction time in rear-end collision situations; however, it is not clear which type of signal is the most effective. Although verbal and symbolic (e.g., a car horn) warnings have faster response times than abstract warnings, they often lead to more response errors. METHOD: Participants (N=20) experienced four nonlooming auditory warnings (constant intensity, pulsed, ramped, and car horn), three looming auditory warnings (\"veridical,\" \"early,\" and \"late\"), and a no-warning condition. In 80% of the trials, warnings were activated when a critical response was required, and in 20% of the trials, the warnings were false alarms. For the early (late) looming warnings, the rate of change of intensity signaled a time to collision (TTC) that was shorter (longer) than the actual TTC. RESULTS: Veridical looming and car horn warnings had significantly faster brake reaction times (BRT) compared with the other nonlooming warnings (by 80 to 160 ms). However, the number of braking responses in false alarm conditions was significantly greater for the car horn. BRT increased significantly and systematically as the TTC signaled by the looming warning was changed from early to veridical to late. CONCLUSION: Looming auditory warnings produce the best combination of response speed and accuracy. APPLICATION: The results indicate that looming auditory warnings can be used to effectively warn a driver about an impending collision.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of two physiological measures for discriminating between levels of cognitive demand under driving conditions across different age groups. BACKGROUND: Previous driving research presents a mixed picture concerning the sensitivity of physiological measures for differentiating tasks with presumed differences in mental workload. METHOD: A total of 108 relatively healthy drivers balanced by gender and across three age groups (20-29, 40-49, 60-69) engaged in three difficulty levels of an auditory presentation-verbal response working memory task. RESULTS: Heart rate and skin conductance level (SCL) both increased in a statistically significant fashion with each incremental increase in cognitive demand, whereas driving performance measures did not provide incremental discrimination. SCL was lower in the 40s and 60s age groups; however, the pattern of incremental increase with higher demand was consistent for heart rate and SCL across all age groups. Although each measure was quite sensitive at the group level, considering both SCL and heart rate improved detection of periods of heightened cognitive demand at the individual level. CONCLUSION: The data provide clear evidence that two basic physiological measures can be utilized under field conditions to differentiate multiple levels of objectively defined changes in cognitive demand. Methodological considerations, including task engagement, may account for some of the inconsistencies in previous research. APPLICATION: These findings increase the confidence with which these measures may be applied to assess relative differences in mental workload when developing and optimizing human machine interface (HMI) designs and in exploring their potential role in advanced workload detection and augmented cognition systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined perceived time to collision (TTC) with automobile drivers under realistic approach, rear-end crash scenario conditions. BACKGROUND: TTC refers to the time before impact if prevailing conditions continue. METHOD: In this test track study involving 51 drivers ranging from 20 to 70 years old, the driver's vision was occluded at either 3.6 or 5.6 s TTC during an in-lane approach to a lead vehicle. Drivers provided TTC estimates by pressing a button the instant they felt that they would have collided with the vehicle ahead. RESULTS: Results indicated that TTC was consistently underestimated. The TTC ratio (perceived TTC\/actual TTC) increased as driver speed decreased and as relative speed increased. These ratios were largely unaffected by age, gender, actual TTC, viewing time (1 s vs. continuous), and the presence of an eyes-forward, mental addition distraction task. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that under these low TTC conditions drivers estimate TTC in a relatively uniform fashion and that they are capable of providing this estimate based on a brief glimpse to the vehicle ahead.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Four head-related transfer function (HRTF) data sets were compared to determine the effect of HRTF measurement methodology on the localization of spatialized auditory stimuli. BACKGROUND: Spatial audio interfaces typically require HRTF data sets to generate the spatialized auditory stimuli. HRTF measurement is accomplished using a variety of techniques that can require several nearly arbitrary decisions about methodology. The effects of these choices upon the resulting spatial audio interface are unclear. METHOD: Sixteen participants completed a sound localization task that included real-world, broadband stimuli spatialized at eight locations on the horizontal plane. Four different HRTF data sets were utilized to spatialize the stimuli: two publicly available HRTF data sets and two data sets obtained using different in-house measurement systems. All HRTFs were obtained from the Knowles Electronics Mannequin for Acoustics Research. RESULTS: Unsigned localization error and proportion of front\/back reversals did not differ significantly across HRTF data sets. Poorest accuracy was observed in locations near the medial (front\/back) axis of the listener, mainly because of the relatively large proportions of reversals at these locations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the particular generalized HRTF data set chosen for spatialization is of minimal importance to the localizability of the resulting stimuli. APPLICATION: This result will inform the design of many spatial audio interfaces that are based upon generalized HRTFs, including wayfaring devices, communication systems, and virtual reality systems.

{"abstract":"This study assessed the effects of spatialized sound presentation on a listener's ability to monitor target (T) messages in the presence of competing (C) messages and high-level (110 dB[A]) background noise (BGN). In a simulated military environment, 8 participants wore two-channel, active noise reduction (ANR) equipped helmets and listened to combinations of T and C messages (89 dB[A] at the ear). T messages were presented synchronously with 0, 1, 2, and 3 C messages in four listening modes: (a) BGN + diotic, (b) BGN + dichotic, (c) BGN + spatial audio, and (d) quiet + spatial audio. Best overall performance occurred in the spatialized modes (c and d) and poorest in the diotic mode (a). As expected, speech recognition was better in quiet than in BGN when multiple C messages were present. Findings indicate that message spatialization in acoustic space improves auditory performance during times of heavy message competition, even in high-level noise. The proposed technology has numerous applications, such as multichannel communications in tactical operations centers, monitoring of complex security systems, and air traffic control.

RESULTS showed that there is a significant difference in the driving habits of an internal combustion vehicle and that of an electric vehicle. Particularly a development from stronger accelerating and decelerating within the first experiences with electric vehicles to a more calm driving after 5 months of experience was noticeable in acceleration and braking maneuvers. Additionally, results for constant driving proved that interaction with electric vehicles with one-pedal driving capability is not a barrier for efficient driving with constant velocity.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The effects of a forward collision warning (FCW) and braking system (FCW+) were examined in a driving simulator study analyzing driving and gaze behavior and the engagement in a secondary task. BACKGROUND: In-depth accident analyses indicate that a lack of appropriate expectations for possible critical situations and visual distraction may be the major causes of rear-end crashes. Studies with FCW systems have shown that a warning alone was not enough for a driver to be able to avoid the accident. Thus,an additional braking intervention by such systems could be necessary. METHOD: In a driving simulator experiment, 30 drivers took part in a car-following scenario in an urban area. It was assumed that different lead car behaviors and environmental aspects would lead to different drivers' expectations of the future traffic situation. Driving with and without FCW+ was introduced as a between-subjects factor. RESULTS: Driving with FCW+ resulted in significantly fewer accidents in critical situations. This result was achieved by the system's earlier reaction time as compared with that of drivers. The analysis of the gaze behavior showed that driving with the system did not lead to a stronger involvement in secondary tasks. CONCLUSION: The study supports the hypotheses about the importance of missing expectations for the occurrence of accidents. These accidents can be prevented by an FCW+ that brakes autonomously. APPLICATION: The results indicate that an autonomous braking intervention should be implemented in FCW systems to increase the effectiveness of these assistance systems.

{"abstract":"We present a method for automatically identifying and validating predictive relationships between the visual appearance of a city and its non-visual attributes (e.g. crime statistics, housing prices, population density etc.). Given a set of street-level images and (location, city-attribute-value) pairs of measurements, we first identify visual elements in the images that are discriminative of the attribute. We then train a predictor by learning a set of weights over these elements using non-linear Support Vector Regression. To perform these operations efficiently, we implement a scalable distributed processing framework that speeds up the main computational bottleneck (extracting visual elements) by an order of magnitude. This speedup allows us to investigate a variety of city attributes across 6 different American cities. We find that indeed there is a predictive relationship between visual elements and a number of city attributes including violent crime rates, theft rates, housing prices, population density, tree presence, graffiti presence, and the perception of danger. We also test human performance for predicting theft based on street-level images and show that our predictor outperforms this baseline with 33% higher accuracy on average. Finally, we present three prototype applications that use our system to (1) define the visual boundary of city neighborhoods, (2) generate walking directions that avoid or seek out exposure to city attributes, and (3) validate user-specified visual elements for prediction.

{"abstract":"Loneliness is a common condition in elderly associated with severe health consequences including increased mortality, decreased cognitive function, and poor quality of life. Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important-especially in the home setting-as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression. Our approach was both sensitive (0.939) and specific (0.975) in detecting time out-of-home across over 41 000 epochs of data collected from four subjects monitored for at least 30 days each in their own homes.

{"abstract":"In this research, we examined cultural differences in morality in the real and virtual worlds and the relationship between the two. Approximately 600 Chinese and 600 U.S. youth, average age 12 years old, completed surveys assessing their moral attitudes and behavior in the real world and the acceptability of a diverse set of morally questionable online behaviors. Findings indicated that (a) Chinese youth considered good moral character to be more important than did U.S. youth, whereas U.S. youth considered exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals to be more acceptable than did Chinese youth; (b) Chinese females had the highest level of moral behavior, followed by U.S. females and then Chinese and U.S. males, who did not differ; (c) Chinese youth found morally questionable online behaviors to be more acceptable than did U.S. youth, with the exception of videogame violence, which U.S. youth, especially males, found more acceptable; (d) moral attitudes and behavior in the real world predicted the acceptability of morally questionable online behaviors, whereas the importance of good moral character and the extent of Internet and other technology use did not. The more accepting youth were of exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals, and the less moral their behavior in the real world, the more acceptable they found morally questionable online behaviors. Cultural differences are explained in terms of differences in perceptions of cyberspace as a venue for expressing individual autonomy. Language: en","authors":["Linda A.

{"abstract":"Evidence exists that virtual worlds reduce pain perception by providing distraction. However, there is no experimental study to show that the type of world used in virtual reality (VR) distraction influences pain perception. Therefore, we investigated whether pain triggered by heat or cold stimuli is modulated by \"warm \"or \"cold \" virtual environments and whether virtual worlds reduce pain perception more than does static picture presentation. We expected that cold worlds would reduce pain perception from heat stimuli, while warm environments would reduce pain perception from cold stimuli. Additionally, both virtual worlds should reduce pain perception in general. Heat and cold pain stimuli thresholds were assessed outside VR in 48 volunteers in a balanced crossover design. Participants completed three 4-minute assessment periods: virtual \"walks \" through (1) a winter and (2) an autumn landscape and static exposure to (3) a neutral landscape. During each period, five heat stimuli or three cold stimuli were delivered via a thermode on the participant's arm, and affective and sensory pain perceptions were rated. Then the thermode was changed to the other arm, and the procedure was repeated with the opposite pain stimuli (heat or cold). We found that both warm and cold virtual environments reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness for heat and cold pain stimuli when compared to the control condition. Since participants wore a head-mounted display (HMD) in both the control condition and VR, we concluded that the distracting value of virtual environments is not explained solely by excluding perception of the real world. Although VR reduced pain unpleasantness, we found no difference in efficacy between the types of virtual world used for each pain stimulus.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the decision times for left-right decisions for a dual-coded advisory turn indicator and a typical spatial-only turn indicator in a GPS navigational map display. BACKGROUND: Track-up maps are useful for turn decision making but do not facilitate configural knowledge acquisition of an area. North-up maps present a stable orientation for this type of learning, but typical implementations of north-up map displays lead to misaligned and confusing turn information. We compared a typical spatial-only indicator with a dual-coded spatial-plus-verbal indicator, systematically manipulating vehicle heading and measuring reaction time. The new display, the Dual-Coded Advisory Turn Indicator for Maps (DATIM), was based on an assumption of the advantages of concurrent verbal and spatial processing of advisory turn indicators in map displays. METHOD: The experimental design was a 2 x 2 x 24 mixed design with indicator type as a between-subjects factor and turn direction (left, right) and 24 heading angles (15 degrees intervals) as repeated-measures factors. Participants made turn decisions while viewing static displays of intersections at variably rotated headings. RESULTS: Reaction time for the DATIM display was consistently faster than the typical spatial-only indicator at all heading angles but especially at heading angles beyond +\/- 45 degrees (520-ms difference at 180 degrees). CONCLUSION: The DATIM display produced faster turn decisions at all heading angles. APPLICATION: DATIM displays could allow north-up maps to be used for turn-by-turn decision making in GPS navigational systems. Drivers could have the advantages of both the stable orientation to facilitate planning and the easy turn-by-turn guidance. Limitations are discussed. Language: en","authors":["Caitlan A.

{"abstract":"Successful behavior requires a finely-tuned interplay of initiating and inhibiting motor programs to react effectively to constantly changing environmental demands. One particularly useful paradigm for investigating inhibitory motor control is the Stop-signal task, where already-initiated responses to Go-stimuli are to be inhibited upon the rapid subsequent presentation of a Stop-stimulus (yielding successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials). Despite the extensive use of this paradigm in functional neuroimaging, there is no consensus on which functional comparison to use to characterize response-inhibition-related brain activity. Here, we utilize conjunction analyses of successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials that are each contrasted against a reference condition. This conjunction approach identifies processes common to both Stop-trial types while excluding processes specific to either, thereby capitalizing on the presence of some response-inhibition-related activity in both conditions. Using this approach on fMRI data from human subjects, we identify a network of brain structures that was linked to both types of Stop-trials, including lateral-inferior-frontal and medial-frontal cortical areas and the caudate nucleus. In addition, comparisons with a reference condition matched for visual stimulation identified additional activity in the right inferior parietal cortex that may play a role in enhancing the processing of the Stop-stimuli. Finally, differences in stopping efficacy across subjects were associated with variations in activity in the left anterior insula. However, this region was also associated with general task accuracy (which furthermore correlated directly with stopping efficacy), suggesting that it might actually reflect a more general mechanism of performance control that supports response inhibition in a relatively nonspecific way.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examine the effects of two different kinds of decision-aiding automation errors on human-automation interaction (HAI), occurring at the first failure following repeated exposure to correctly functioning automation. The two errors are incorrect advice, triggering the automation bias, and missing advice, reflecting complacency. BACKGROUND: Contrasts between analogous automation errors in alerting systems, rather than decision aiding, have revealed that alerting false alarms are more problematic to HAI than alerting misses are. Prior research in decision aiding, although contrasting the two aiding errors (incorrect vs. missing), has confounded error expectancy. METHOD: Participants performed an environmental process control simulation with and without decision aiding. For those with the aid, automation dependence was created through several trials of perfect aiding performance, and an unexpected automation error was then imposed in which automation was either gone (one group) or wrong (a second group). A control group received no automation support. RESULTS: The correct aid supported faster and more accurate diagnosis and lower workload. The aid failure degraded all three variables, but \"automation wrong\" had a much greater effect on accuracy, reflecting the automation bias, than did \"automation gone,\" reflecting the impact of complacency. Some complacency was manifested for automation gone, by a longer latency and more modest reduction in accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Automation wrong, creating the automation bias, appears to be a more problematic form of automation error than automation gone, reflecting complacency. IMPLICATIONS: Decision-aiding automation should indicate its lower degree of confidence in uncertain environments to avoid the automation bias. Language: en","authors":["Christopher D.

{"abstract":"This work is part of the development of a remote home healthcare monitoring application designed to detect distress situations through several types of sensors. The multi-sensor fusion can provide more accurate and reliable information compared to information provided by each sensor separately. Furthermore, data from multiple heterogeneous sensors present in the remote home healthcare monitoring systems have different degrees of imperfection and trust. Among the multi-sensor fusion methods, Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is currently considered the most appropriate for representing and processing the imperfect information. Based on a graphical representation of the DST called Evidential Networks, a structure of heterogeneous data fusion from multiple sensors for fall detection has been proposed. The Evidential Networks, implemented on our remote medical monitoring platform, are also proposed in this work to maximize the performance of automatic fall detection and thus make the system more reliable. However, the presence of noise, the variability of recorded signals by the sensors and the failing or unreliable sensors may thwart the Evidential Networks performance. In addition, the sensors signals non-stationary nature may degrade the experimental conditions. To compensate the non-stationary effect, the time evolution is consider by introducing the Dynamic Evidential Networks which was evaluated by the simulated fall scenarios corresponding to various use cases.

{"abstract":"Deficits in response inhibition and heightened impulsivity have been linked to psychiatric disorders and aggression. They have been investigated in clinical groups as well as individuals with trait characteristics, yielding insights into the underlying neural and behavioral mechanisms of response inhibition and impulsivity. The motor inhibition tasks employed in most studies, however, have lacked an emotional component, which is crucial given that both response inhibition and impulsivity attain salience within a socio-emotional context. For this fMRI study, we selected a group with high trait aggression (HA, n=17) and one with low trait aggression (LA, n=16) from 550 males who had completed an Aggression Questionnaire. Neural activation was compared to an emotional version (including angry and neutral faces) of the stop signal task. Behavioral results revealed impaired response inhibition in HA, associated with higher motor impulsivity. This was accompanied by attenuated activation in brain regions involved in response inhibition, including the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and motor cortex. Together, these findings offer evidence that a reduced inhibition capacity is present in HA. Notably, response inhibition improved during anger trials in both groups, suggesting a facilitation effect through heightened activation in the related brain regions. In both groups, inclusion of the anger stimuli enhanced activation of the motor and somatosensory areas, which modulate executive control, and of limbic regions including the amygdala. In summary, the investigation of response inhibition in individuals with high and low trait characteristics affords useful insights into the underlying distinct processing mechanisms. It can contribute to the investigation of trait markers in a clinical context without having to deal with the complex mechanisms of a clinical disorder itself. In contrast, the mechanisms of emotional response inhibition did not differ between groups. Hence, the specific emotional influence is not interacting with trait aggression.

{"abstract":"This paper proposes a new theory to account for the effects of underload on performance. Malleable attentional resources theory posits that attentional capacity can change size in response to changes in task demands. As such, the performance decrements associated with mental underload can be explained by a lack of appropriate attentional resources. These proposals were explored in a driving simulator experiment. Vehicle automation was manipulated at 4 levels, and mental workload was assessed with a secondary task. Eye movements were also recorded to determine whether attentional capacity varied with mental workload. The results showed a clear decrease in mental workload associated with some levels of automation. Most striking, though, were the results derived from the eye movement recordings, which demonstrated that attentional capacity varies directly with level of mental workload. These data fully supported the predictions of the new theory. Malleable attentional resources theory suggests that future vehicle designers should employ their technology in driver support systems rather than in automation to replace the driver. The implications of this theory are discussed with regard to capacity models of attention as well as to the design of future vehicle systems. Language: en","authors":["Mark S. Young","Neville A.

METHOD: Sixty students performed four tasks in SYNWORK1, for which points are received for correct responses and lost for incorrect responses. Individual-task payoffs were varied between participants and were changed after 8 and 12 sessions to examine the effects of a previous strategy on development of a new strategy. RESULTS: Participants were sensitive to initial payoffs and modified their strategies when payoffs changed. However, residual effects of prior payoffs were evident. CONCLUSION: Payoffs for multiple-task environments need to be explicit, and practice should be provided for strategy development. When payoffs change, strategies adopted reflect current and previous payoffs. APPLICATION: The findings can be applied to the design of payoff schedules for multiple-task environments.

{"abstract":"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been one of the \"signature injuries\" of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, neuroimaging studies in concussive 'mild' blast-related TBI have been challenging due to the absence of abnormalities in computed tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the heterogeneity of the blast-related injury mechanisms. The goal of this study was to address these challenges utilizing single-subject, module-based graph theoretic analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. We acquired 20min of resting-state fMRI in 63 U.S. military personnel clinically diagnosed with concussive blast-related TBI and 21 U.S. military controls who had blast exposures but no diagnosis of TBI. All subjects underwent an initial scan within 90days post-injury and 65 subjects underwent a follow-up scan 6 to 12months later. A second independent cohort of 40 U.S. military personnel with concussive blast-related TBI served as a validation dataset. The second independent cohort underwent an initial scan within 30days post-injury. 75% of the scans were of good quality, with exclusions primarily due to excessive subject motion. Network analysis of the subset of these subjects in the first cohort with good quality scans revealed spatially localized reductions in the participation coefficient, a measure of between-module connectivity, in the TBI patients relative to the controls at the time of the initial scan. These group differences were less prominent on the follow-up scans. The 15 brain areas with the most prominent reductions in the participation coefficient were next used as regions of interest (ROIs) for single-subject analyses.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 30 hr of sleep loss and continuous cognitive work on performance in a distributed team decision-making environment. BACKGROUND: To date, only a few studies have examined the effect of sleep loss on distributed team performance, and only one other to our knowledge has examined the relationship between sleep loss and social-motivational aspects of teams (Hoeksema-van Orden, Gaillard, & Buunk, 1998). METHOD: Sixteen teams participated; each comprised 4 members. Three team members made threat assessments on a military surveillance task and then forwarded their judgments electronically to a team leader, who made a final assessment on behalf of the team. RESULTS: Sleep loss had an antagonistic effect on team decision-making accuracy and decision time. However, the performance loss associated with fatigue attributable to sleep loss was mediated by being part of a team, as compared with performing the same task individually - that is, we found evidence of a \"motivational gain\" effect in these sleepy teams. We compare these results with those of Hoeksema-van Orden et al. (1998), who found clear evidence of a \"social loafing\" effect in sleepy teams. CONCLUSION: The divergent results are discussed in the context of the collective effort model (Karau & Williams, 1993) and are attributable in part to a difference between independent and interdependent team tasks. APPLICATION: The issues and findings have implications for a wide range of distributed, collaborative work environments, such as military network-enabled operations.

{"abstract":"The development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) will be a crucial element in the construction of future intelligent transportation systems with the objective of reducing the number of traffic accidents and their subsequent fatalities. Specifically, driving behaviors could be monitored online to determine the crash risk and provide warning information to the driver via their ADAS. In this paper, we focus on aggressiveness as one of the potential causes of traffic accidents. We demonstrate that aggressiveness can be detected by monitoring external driving signals such as lateral and longitudinal accelerations and speed. We model aggressiveness as a linear filter operating on these signals, thus scaling their probability distribution functions and modifying their mean value, standard deviation, and dynamic range. Next, we proceed to validate this model via an experiment, conducted under real driving conditions, involving ten different drivers, traveling a route with five different types of road sections, subject to both smooth and aggressive behaviors. The obtained results confirm the validity of the model of aggressiveness. In addition, they show the generality of this model and its applicability to specific driving signals (speed, longitudinal, and lateral accelerations), every single driver, and every road type. Finally, we build a classifier capable of detecting aggressive behavior from the driving signal. This classifier achieves a success rate up to 92%.

{"abstract":"Cyberbullying victimization is associated with a range of emotional and behavioral outcomes for adolescents. However, previous research has shown that this type of victimization does not affect all individuals negatively. The factors that account for individual differences in reactions to the same online experiences are not well understood. Using a qualitative inductive approach, a set of strong themes relating to factors that either increased the severity of impact of cyberbullying victimization or buffered victims against the impact emerged from interviews with 25 adolescents aged 15-24 years. Themes related to publicity, anonymity of perpetrators, features of the medium, presence of bystanders, and individual level factors were identified as potential influences upon impact severity. The implications of these results for further research and for school\/university cyberbullying prevention programs for victims, perpetrators, and bystanders are discussed.

{"abstract":"Processing evidence that disconfirms a prior interpretation is a fundamental aspect of belief revision, and has clear social and clinical relevance. This complex cognitive process requires (at minimum) an alerting stage and an integration stage, and in the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used multivariate analysis methodology on two datasets in an attempt to separate these sequentially-activated cognitive stages and link them to distinct functional brain networks. Thirty-nine healthy participants completed one of two versions of an evidence integration experiment involving rating two consecutive animal images, both of which consisted of two intact images of animal faces morphed together at different ratios (e.g., 70\/30 bird\/dolphin followed by 10\/90 bird\/dolphin). The two versions of the experiment differed primarily in terms of stimulus presentation and timing, which facilitated functional interpretation of brain networks based on differences in the hemodynamic response shapes between versions. The data were analyzed using constrained principal component analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA), which allows distinct, simultaneously active task-based networks to be separated, and these were interpreted using both temporal (task-based hemodynamic response shapes) and spatial (dominant brain regions) information. Three networks showed increased activity during integration of disconfirmatory relative to confirmatory evidence: (1) a network involved in alerting to the requirement to revise an interpretation, identified as the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula); (2) a sensorimotor response-related network (pre- and post-central gyri, supplementary motor area, and thalamus); and (3) an integration network involving rostral prefrontal, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortex. These three networks were staggered in their peak activity (alerting, responding, then integrating), but at certain time points (e.g., 17seconds after trial onset) the hemodynamic responses associated with all three networks were simultaneously active. These findings highlight distinct cognitive processes and corresponding functional brain networks underlying stages of disconfirmatory evidence integration, and demonstrate the power of multivariate and multi-experiment methodology in cognitive neuroscience.

One small study reported that VR can safely be used in individuals with current persecutory delusions. The present pilot study investigated the feasibility and potential negative side effects of exposure to different virtual social risk environments in patients with first episode psychosis and in healthy controls. Seventeen patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) participated in four virtual experiments during which they walked for 3.5-4 minutes in a virtual cafe, looking for avatars with digits on their clothing. The level of paranoid thoughts, as well as psychological, physiological, and behavioral correlates of paranoid thoughts, were measured in different virtual social risk environments, manipulating two factors: population density and ethnicity of avatars. FEP and HC frequently had paranoid thoughts about avatars. Paranoia in the real world correlated strongly with paranoid thoughts about avatars in virtual environments (Spearman's \u03c1=0.67 and 0.54 in FEP and HC respectively, p Language: en","authors":["Wim Veling","Willem-Paul Brinkman","Emily Dorrestijn","Mark van der Gaag"],"id":"63615aae-583d-4039-ad34-0d7dd4d26494","n_citation":21,"references":["6cdfab18-bcee-457b-9b13-e918667d8db6","e0f7a292-6a66-4d96-871f-28f990eda895"],"title":"Virtual Reality Experiments Linking Social Environment and Psychosis: A Pilot Study","venue":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","year":2014}
{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of workload history (specifically, sudden shifts in workload) on performance. BACKGROUND: In 1993 the National Research Council identified workload transition as an important concern for human factors researchers. The study of workload history suggests that what an individual has been doing prior to a point in time has an effect on subsequent performance. One trend emerging from workload history studies is that a general decrement in performance is most likely to occur following a decrease in task demand. METHOD: The 198 participants were randomly assigned to a high-to-low or low-to-high condition. Participants performed a version of the Bakan Vigilance Task while correct responses, response times, and total errors were recorded. RESULTS: Results supported previous research suggesting a workload decrease results in a performance decrement. More importantly, this study reports that either a sudden increase or decrease could lead to a loss in accuracy and a slowing of response time in a longer time course. CONCLUSION: An explanation of the decrement is offered in terms of adaptation models. In addition, a follow-up study suggested that the decrement is a result of something inherent in the workload shift rather than an effect of fatigue. APPLICATION: Workload history (more specifically, a workload shift) has significant implications for many work environments. These implications are particularly salient in occupations where individuals are confronted with varying levels of workload demand, especially safety-sensitive occupations.

{"abstract":"A calculating method and computer program have been developed for solving an overdetermined system of linear equations. It was applied for calculation of group risk exposure of school children (10-15 years) to nonfatal injuries in sport recreation and playing (SRP). Interviewed non-injured school children were separated into non-overlapping groups of risky behavior. Data on interviewed non-injured and non-interviewed injured children were put into a linear system of equations consisting of a 4 x 3 matrix scheme. Each equation represents children of the same age and sex and consists of the percentage of interviewed children grouped into high medium or low risk behavior and of the percentage of injured children. Four methods of calculating the matrix system were evaluated and the best implemented as a new developed computer program. The resulting linear group risk factors enable the prediction of behavior outcome. Data on interviewed injured children were compared with the results obtained. The validation procedure is proposed by testing the sensitivity and robustness of the method.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: It was investigated how speed limit repetition and distraction affect drivers' speed management throughout a road section where the imposed speed limit is not in accordance (too low) with road design. BACKGROUND: It is not clear how driving speed evolves and to what degree speed limit repetition is necessary on roads where the imposed speed limit is not in accordance (too low) with road design. It is furthermore of interest how all these factors are influenced by driver distraction. METHOD: In a driving simulator, 47 volunteers completed one trip with and without distraction. Within each trip, three configurations were presented: speed limit sign repetition after every intersection, repetition only in the middle of a segment, or no repetition. RESULTS: Distraction lowered driving speed. Speed management varied depending on speed limit repetition. The speed limit was exceeded more often when speed limit signs were repeated less frequently. When drivers were not reminded of the limit, speed linearly increased throughout the segment. In all three configurations, speed increased toward the end of the segment, but this increase was largest when there had been no repetition at all of the speed limit. CONCLUSION: In low-demanding road designs that allow drivers to exceed the speed limit, limit repetition is necessary. Frequent repetition may be preferred, as speed management was most homogenous in that case. APPLICATION: The proposed analysis of speed management throughout a section increases our understanding of how speed evolves and thereby shows where repetition of the speed limit is necessary.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a time-efficient method, based on an adaptive psychophysical technique, to reliably determine the boundary of the conspicuity area. Because full-field mapping is time consuming, estimating the boundary from only a limited amount of target presentations is attractive. BACKGROUND: Detectability of visual targets can be evaluated by measuring their associated conspicuity areas. Earlier literature reported elliptical conspicuity areas, but later research that found shape irregularities brought into question the validity of using techniques based on this assumption to approach the area's boundary. METHOD: Eight participants were required to view briefly presented target-background combinations, with successive target positions depending on preceding observer responses. RESULTS: Nonlinear least squares curve fitting showed conspicuity areas to be elliptical. Results from response time (RT) studies supported the finding, showing that slopes of RT versus eccentricity functions were markedly steeper at positions outside the conspicuity area than at those within. CONCLUSION: It is proposed that the developed method provides a time-efficient and accurate means to measure the conspicuity area. APPLICATION: The findings are applicable to industries in which target detectability needs to be assessed in order to either reduce (e.g., for camouflage) or enhance detectability (e.g., road safety).

{"abstract":"This study investigated human-machine cooperation when driving with different degrees of a shared control system. By means of a direct intervention on the steering wheel, shared control systems partially correct the vehicle's trajectory and, at the same time, provide continuous haptic guidance to the driver. A crucial point is to determine the optimal level of steering assistance for effective cooperation between the two agents. Five system settings were compared with a condition in which no assistance was present. In addition, road visibility was manipulated by means of additional fog or self-controlled visual occlusions. Several performance indicators and subjective assessments were analyzed. The results show that the best repartition of control in terms of cooperation between human and machine can be identified through an analysis of the steering wheel reversal rate, the steering effort and the mean lateral position of the vehicle. The best cooperation was achieved with systems of relatively low-level haptic authority, although more intervention may be preferable in poor visibility conditions. Increasing haptic authority did not yield higher benefits in terms of steering behavior, visual demand or subjective feeling.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments are described that examined operators' perceptions of decision aids. BACKGROUND: Research has suggested certain biases against automation that influence human interaction with automation. We differentiated preconceived biases from post hoc biases and examined their effects on advice acceptance. METHOD: In Study 1 we examined operators' trust in and perceived reliability of humans versus automation of varying pedigree (expert vs. novice), based on written descriptions of these advisers prior to operators' interacting with these advisers. In Study 2 we examined participants' post hoc trust in, perceived reliability of, and dependence on these advisers after their objective experience of advisers' reliability (90% vs. 70%) in a luggage-screening task. RESULTS: In Study 1 measures of perceived reliability indicated that automation was perceived as more reliable than humans across pedigrees. Measures of trust indicated that automated \"novices\" were trusted more than human \"novices\"; human \"experts\" were trusted more than automated \"experts.\" In Study 2, perceived reliability varied as a function of pedigree, whereas subjective trust was always higher for automation than for humans. Advice acceptance from novice automation was always higher than from novice humans. However, when advisers were 70% reliable, errors generated by expert automation led to a drop in compliance\/reliance on expert automation relative to expert humans. CONCLUSION: Preconceived expectations of automation influence the use of these aids in actual tasks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of proximity and time pressure on accurate and effective visual search during medication selection from a computer screen. BACKGROUND: The presence of multiple similar objects in proximity to a target object increases the difficulty of a visual search. Visual similarity between drug names can also lead to selection error. The proximity of several similarly named drugs within a visual field could, therefore, adversely affect visual search. METHOD: In Study 1, 60 nonpharmacy participants selected a target drug name from an array of mock drug packets shown on a computer screen, where one or four similarly named nontargets might be present. Of the participants, 30 completed the task with a time constraint, and the remainder did not. In Study 2, the same experiment was repeated with 28 pharmacy staff. RESULTS: In Study 1, the proximity of multiple similarly named nontargets within the specified visual field reduced selection accuracy and increased reaction times in the nonpharmacists. Time constraint also had an adverse effect. In Study 2, the pharmacy participants showed increased reaction times when multiple nontargets were present, but the time constraint had no effect. There was no effect of Tall Man lettering. CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple similarly named medications in close proximity to a target medication increases the difficulty of the visual search for the target. Tall Man lettering has no impact on this adverse effect.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to investigate potential benefits of likelihood alarm systems (LASs) over binary alarm systems (BASs) in a multitask environment. BACKGROUND: Several problems are associated with the use of BASs, because most of them generate high numbers of false alarms. Operators lose trust in the systems and ignore alarms or cross-check all of them when other information is available. The first behavior harms safety, whereas the latter one reduces productivity. LASs represent an alternative, which is supposed to improve operators' attention allocation. METHOD: We investigated LASs and BASs in a dual-task paradigm with and without the possibility to cross-check alerts with raw data information. Participants' trust in the system, their behavior, and their performance in the alert and the concurrent task were assessed. RESULTS: Reported trust, compliance with alarms, and performance in the alert and the concurrent task were higher for the LAS than for the BAS. The cross-check option led to an increase in alert task performance for both systems and a decrease in concurrent task performance for the BAS, which did not occur in the LAS condition. CONCLUSION: LASs improve participants' attention allocation between two different tasks and therefore lead to an increase in alert task and concurrent task performance. The performance maximum is achieved when LAS is combined with a cross-check option for validating alerts with additional information. APPLICATION: The use of LASs instead of BASs in safety-related multitask environments has the potential to increase safety and productivity likewise.

{"abstract":"In recent years, many accident models and techniques have shifted their focus from shortfalls in the actions of practitioners to systemic causes in the organization. Accident investigation techniques (e.g., STAMP) have been developed that looked into the flaws of control processes in the organization. Organizational models have looked into general patterns of breakdown related to structural vulnerabilities and gradual degradation of performance. Although some degree of cross-fertilization has been developed between these two trends, safety analysts are left on their own to integrate this gap between control flaws and patterns of organizational breakdown in accident investigation. This article attempts to elaborate the control dynamics of the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) technique on the basis of a theoretical model of organizational viability (i.e., the Viable Systems Model). The joint STAMP-VSM framework is applied to an accident from a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) organization to help analysts progress from the analysis of control flaws to the underlying patterns of breakdown. The joint framework may help analysts to rethink the safety organization, model new information loops and constraints, look at the adaptation and steering functions of the organization and finally, develop high leverage interventions.

{"abstract":"Efficient emotion regulation is essential for social interaction and functioning in human society and often happens without direct intention and conscious awareness. Cognitive labeling of stimuli based on certain characteristics has been assumed to represent an effective strategy of implicit emotional regulation whereas processing based on simple perceptual characteristics (e.g., matching) has not. Evidence exists that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) might be of functional relevance during labeling by down-regulating limbic activity in the presence of threatening stimuli. However, it remained unclear whether this VLPFC activation was particularly specific to threat because previous studies focused exclusively on threatening stimuli. In the current study, 35 healthy participants labeled or matched both threatening and neutral pictures while undergoing 52-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed increased VLPFC activation during labeling of threatening but not neutral pictures. No increase in prefrontal activation was detected during matching. Moreover, skin conductance increased equally for both valence conditions during initial phases of labeling whereas during matching stronger increases were found for threatening stimuli. Although a general inverse relationship between VLPFC function and skin conductance was not confirmed, both were negatively correlated during matching of threatening pictures in subjects with high state anxiety. It was concluded that the VLPFC plays an essential role during implicit emotion regulation. Further, even simple perceptual processing seems to engage regulatory top-down activation in anxious individuals. Language: en","authors":["Sara V.

In this manuscript, we studied the interplay between positive and negative ties on mesoscopic level of these networks, i.e., their community structure. A community is considered as a tightly interconnected group of actors; therefore, it does not borrow any assumption from balance theory and merely uses the well-known assumption in the community detection literature. We found that if one detects the communities based on only positive relations (by ignoring the negative ones), the majority of negative relations are already placed between the communities. In other words, negative ties do not have a major role in community formation of signed networks. Moreover, regarding the internal negative ties, we proved that most unbalanced communities are maximally balanced, and hence they cannot be partitioned into k nonempty sub-clusters with higher balancedness (k\u22652). Furthermore, we showed that although the mediator triad ++- (hostile-mediator-hostile) is underrepresented, it constitutes a considerable portion of triadic relations among communities. Hence, mediator triads should not be ignored by community detection and clustering algorithms. As a result, if one uses a clustering algorithm that operates merely based on social balance, mesoscopic structure of signed networks significantly remains hidden.

{"abstract":"Motivation Road traffic accidents are among the top leading causes of deaths and injuries of various levels in South Africa. With the wealth and huge amount of data generated from road traffic accidents, the issue of traffic accident prediction has become a central challenge in the field of transportation data analysis. Such accident prediction is designed to detect patterns involved in dangerous crashes and thus help decision making and planning before casualty and loss occur. Recently, numerous researchers have presented a wide range of prediction techniques. Most of these methods are based on statistical studies but usually fail to explain the insights of prediction results. This has led to the development and application of supervised learning algorithms (classifiers) in an attempt to provide more accurate accident prediction in terms of injury severity (fatal\/serious\/slight\/property damage with no injury). Even then, the task of learning an accurate classifier from instances raises a number of new issues some of which have not been properly addressed by transportation research. Thus, an effective prediction method is required for improving predictive accuracy. RESULTS The essence of the paper is the proposal that prediction of accidents given poor data quality (in terms of incomplete data) can be improved by using a classifier based on grey relational analysis, a similarity-based method. We evaluate the grey relational classifier with other state-of-the-art classifiers including artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbour, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifier, algorithm quasi-optimal and support vector machines. Real-world road traffic accident dataset is utilized for this task. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the grey relational classifier algorithm in terms of road traffic accident predictive accuracy. 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate prevalence based on variations in case definitions used for epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). BACKGROUND: Prior studies of MSDs have mostly relied on a single case definition based on questionnaires. METHOD: In a multicenter prospective cohort study, we systematically collected data to evaluate impacts of differences in case definitions of MSDs on prevalence of three common musculoskeletal disorders: (a) shoulder tendinosis, (b) lateral epicondylalgia, and (c) carpal tunnel syndrome. Production workers were from 21 employment settings in three diverse U.S. states and performed widely varying work. All workers completed laptop-administered structured interviews, two standardized physical examinations, and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Case definitions included symptoms only, and symptoms plus physical examinations and\/or NCS. RESULTS: A total of 1,227 subjects had complete health data at baseline. The prevalence for shoulder tendinosis is 23.0% if only glenohumeral pain is used for a case definition, compared with 8.0% if a combination of pain plus a positive supraspinatus test is used. The prevalence for lateral epicondylalgia varied on the basis of lateral elbow pain (12.0%), pain plus tenderness on palpation (9.9%), or pain plus tenderness on palpation plus resisted wrist or middle finger extension (3.5%). Carpal tunnel syndrome prevalence varied on the basis of tingling or numbness in a median nerve-served digit (29.9%) or tingling or numbness plus NCS abnormalities consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (9.0%). CONCLUSION: Variations in epidemiological case definitions have major impacts on prevalence of common MSDs. Wide-ranging differences in prevalence may have impacts on purported risk factors that need to be determined. Language: en","authors":["Kurt T. Hegmann","Matthew S.

{"abstract":"Human mobility has been empirically observed to exhibit Levy flight characteristics and behaviour with power-law distributed jump size. The fundamental mechanisms behind this behaviour has not yet been fully explained. In this paper, we propose to explain the Levy walk behaviour observed in human mobility patterns by decomposing them into different classes according to the different transportation modes, such as Walk\/Run, Bike, Train\/Subway or Car\/Taxi\/Bus. Our analysis is based on two real-life GPS datasets containing approximately 10 and 20 million GPS samples with transportation mode information. We show that human mobility can be modelled as a mixture of different transportation modes, and that these single movement patterns can be approximated by a lognormal distribution rather than a power-law distribution. Then, we demonstrate that the mixture of the decomposed lognormal flight distributions associated with each modality is a power-law distribution, providing an explanation to the emergence of Levy Walk patterns that characterize human mobility patterns.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effects of active training on older drivers' scanning in intersections, the present article reports the results of a 2-year followup with drivers who had previously participated the older driver training study reported in Romoser and Fisher. BACKGROUND: Customized feedback coupled with active learning in a simulator has been shown to be an effective means of significantly improving the intersection scanning behavior of older drivers. However, the long-term effect of such training has not been established. METHOD: Older drivers from the active learning and control groups from Romoser and Fisher were invited to participate in a 2-year follow-up field drive in their own vehicle starting at their home. Secondary looks, defined as looking away from the path of the vehicle while entering the intersections toward regions to the side from which other vehicles could appear, were recorded. RESULTS: Two years after their training, older drivers in the active learning group still took secondary looks more than one and a half times as often as 2009 pretraining levels. Control group drivers saw no significant change in performance over the 2-year period. CONCLUSION: Customized feedback and active learning in a simulator is an effective strategy for improving the safe driving habits of older drivers over the long term. It provides drivers a means by which to reincorporate previously extinguished behaviors into their driving habits.

{"abstract":"The first moments at a disater scene are chaotic. The command center initially operates with little knowledge of hazards, geography and casualties, building up knowledge of the event slowly as information trickles in by voice radio channels. RealityFlythrough is a tele-presence system that stitches together live video feeds in real-time, using the principle of visual closure, to give command center personnel the illustion of being able to explore the scene interactively by moving smoothly between the video feeds. Using RealityFlythrough, medical, fire, law enforcement, hazardous materials, and engineering experts may be able to achieve situational awareness earlier, and better manage scarce resources. The RealityFlythrough system is composed of camera units with off-the-shelf GPS and orientation systems and a server\/viewing station that offers access to images collected by the camera units in real time by position\/orientation. In initial field testing using an experimental mesh 802.11 wireless network, two camera unit operators were able to create an interactive image of a simulated disaster scene in about five minutes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments examined the detectability of transient changes in cluttered and dynamic displays and optimal scan strategies for performance. BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that onset changes are prioritized by the attention system and onsets are often used to signal important display changes. However, research has mostly used uncluttered, static displays and has largely ignored the role of scan strategy. METHOD: We had participants monitor a cluttered and dynamic display and respond when an object changed color or onset abruptly. Scan strategies were also evaluated. In another experiment participants were instructed to use particular strategies to detect changes. RESULTS: Consistent with previous results, onset events were detected better than were color change events. Scan strategy accounted for a large proportion of variance in detection performance. Participants who made few eye movements performed best. Participants who actively scanned the display performed worst. When poor performers were instructed to make few eye movements, their performance matched that of the best performers. CONCLUSION: Onset alerts can be an effective means of signaling important events in complex displays. Additionally, scan strategy plays an important role in the detection of transient events.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we tested to what extent highly automated convoy driving involving small spacing (\"platooning\") may affect time headway (THW) and standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) during subsequent manual driving. BACKGROUND: Although many previous studies have reported beneficial effects of automated driving, some research has also highlighted potential drawbacks, such as increased speed and reduced THW during the activation of semiautomated driving systems. Here, we rather focused on the question of whether switching from automated to manual driving may produce unwanted carryover effects on safety-relevant driving performance. METHOD: We utilized a pre-post simulator design to measure THW and SDLP after highly automated driving and compared the data with those for a control group (manual driving throughout). RESULTS: Our data revealed that THW was reduced and SDLP increased after leaving the automation mode. A closer inspection of the data suggested that specifically the effect on THW is likely due to sensory and\/or cognitive adaptation processes. CONCLUSION: Behavioral adaptation effects need to be taken into account in future implementations of automated convoy systems. APPLICATION: Potential application areas of this research comprise automated freight traffic (truck convoys) and the design of driver assistance systems in general. Potential countermeasures against following at short distance as behavioral adaptation should be considered.

{"abstract":"Previous research has shown that personality characteristics, such as sensation seeking (SS), are strong predictors of risk-taking behavior during adolescence. However, the relationship between levels of SS and brain response has not been studied during this time period. Given the prevalence of risky behavior during adolescence, it is important to understand neurobiological differences in reward sensitivity between youth with high and low SS personalities. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine differences in brain activity in an adolescent sample that included 27 high (HSS) and 27 low sensation seekers (LSS), defined by the Impulsive Sensation Seeking scale of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman et al., 1993). In the scanner, participants played a modified Wheel of Fortune decision-making task (Cservenka and Nagel, 2012) that resulted in trials with monetary Wins or No Wins. We compared age- and sex-matched adolescent HSS and LSS (mean age = 13.94 \u00b1 1.05) on brain activity by contrasting Win versus No Win trials. Our findings indicate that HSS show greater bilateral insular and prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain response on Win vs. No Win compared to LSS. Analysis of simple effects showed that while LSS showed comparable brain activity in these areas during Wins and No Wins, HSS showed significant differences in brain response to winning (activation) versus not winning (deactivation), with between-group comparison suggesting significant differences in brain response, largely to reward absence. Group differences in insular activation between reward receipt and absence may suggest weak autonomic arousal to negative outcomes in HSS compared with LSS. Additionally, since the PFC is important for goal-directed behavior and attention, the current results may reflect that HSS allocate fewer attentional resources to negative outcomes than LSS. This insensitivity to reward absence in HSS may lead to a greater likelihood of maladaptive choices when negative consequences are not considered, and may be an early neural marker of decreased loss sensitivity that has been seen in addiction. This neurobiological information may ultimately be helpful in establishing prevention strategies aimed at reducing youth risk-taking and suggests value in further examination of neural associations with personality characteristics during adolescence.

Strategic control remains for future study. BACKGROUND: Driving is a complex control task involving operational, tactical, and strategic control. Although operational control, such as lead-car following, has been studied, the influence of in-vehicle distractions on higher levels of control, including tactical and strategic, remains unclear. METHOD: Two secondary tasks were designed to independently represent visual-manual and cognitive-audio distractions, based on multiple resource theory. Drivers performed operational vehicle control maneuvers (lead-car following) or tactical control maneuvers (passing) along with the distraction tasks in a driving simulator. Response measures included driving performance and visual behavior. RESULTS: Results revealed drivers' ability to accommodate either visual or cognitive distractions in following tasks but not in passing. The simultaneous distraction condition led to the greatest decrement in performance.

{"abstract":"This study tested the predictive power of gaming versatility (i.e., the number of video game genres engaged in) on game addiction in male adolescents, controlling for time spent on gaming. Participants were 701 male adolescents attending high school (Mage=15.6 years). Analyses showed that pathological gaming was predicted not only by higher time spent on gaming, but also by participation in a greater number of video game genres. Specifically, the wider the array of video game genres played, the higher were the negative consequences caused by gaming. FINDINGS show that versatility can be considered as one of the behavioral risk factors related to gaming addiction, which may be characterized by a composite and diversified experience with video games. This study suggests that educational efforts designed to prevent gaming addiction among youth may also be focused on adolescents' engagement in different video games.

In this study, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was utilized to evaluate whether activation in the medial sensorimotor cortices reflects the amount of variations seen in the stride-time intervals. Thirteen healthy adults (Age=23.7\u00b11.4yrs.) walked forwards and backwards on a programmable treadmill. Each walking condition consisted of two sessions, with each being comprised of five alternating blocks of standing still or walking at 0.45m\/s. Activation in the medial sensorimotor cortices was measured using an fNIRS system, which consisted of a 4\u00d74 grid of infrared optode emitter\/detector pairs. The optodes were positioned on the participant's head using the International 10\/20 system with Cz located beneath the center of the front two rows of optodes. We evaluated the block-wise changes in the amount of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) in the channels that were located over the supplementary motor area, pre-central gyrus, post-central gyrus and superior parietal lobule. Throughout the experiment, a footswitch system was used to concurrently measure the amount of variation present in the stride-time intervals. Our results showed that oxyHb was greater in the supplementary motor area, pre-central gyrus, and superior parietal lobule when participants walked backwards rather than forwards, which suggests that backward walking presents more of a challenge to the nervous system as it controls the stepping pattern. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the amount of deoxyHb present in the supplementary motor area while walking backward. Consistent with previous investigations, we noted that the amount of variability present in the stride-time intervals was greater during backward walking compared to forward walking. In addition, the amount of variation in the stride-time intervals while walking forward was positively correlated with the maximum oxyHb response found in the pre-central gyrus and supplementary motor area, which has not been previously shown. This neurobehavioral relationship supports the notion that the subtle variations found in the stride-time intervals are partly associated with processing demands by the motor cortices for regulating the forward temporal kinematics.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: With the assumption that circadian rhythms influence human performance, the work of live line electricians was reorganized and evaluated. The hypothesis was that in highly physical and attention-demanding work, the organization of tasks, according to the ideal period of day and day of week, should diminish stress and consequent work risks. BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies reporting the work of electricians and even fewer approaching work organization. Moreover, these investigations often do not consider human physiological limitations and capabilities as well as task demands. METHOD: A new work system was proposed with consideration of (a) the circadian cycles and homeostatic processes; (b) the effect of heat, which is a zeitgeber (synchronizer) for the biological clocks; and (c) the degree of physical and mental demands of the different performed tasks, which was assessed on the basis of opinions of the electricians and physiological markers of stress that are controlled by circadian rhythms. The traditional and new systems were compared on the basis of two cognitive indices (the arrangement of matchsticks and the perception of a minute) and three physiological markers of mental-to-physical loads (heart frequency and the level of adrenaline and noradrenaline). RESULTS: Both physical and mental loads were reduced in the new system. CONCLUSION: Work organization should include consideration of human circadian rhythms, mainly when stressful and high-risk tasks are involved. APPLICATION: The findings can be applied in any work design, but they are especially suited for highly demanding work carried out outdoors.

{"abstract":"We investigated the ability of virtual reality (VR) cue exposure to trigger a desire for alcohol among binge-drinking students. Fifteen binge-drinking college students and eight students who were nonbingers were immersed into a neutral-cue environment or room (underwater scenes), followed by four alcohol-cue rooms (bar, party, kitchen, argument), followed by a repeat of the neutral room. The virtual rooms were computer generated via head-mounted visual displays with associated auditory and olfactory stimuli. In each room, participants reported their subjective cravings for alcohol, the amount of attention given to the sight and smell of alcohol, and how much they were thinking of drinking. A 2 x 6 (type of drinker by VR room) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on the responses to each question. After alcohol exposure, binge drinkers reported significantly higher cravings for and thoughts of alcohol than nonbinge drinkers, whereas differences between the groups following the neutral rooms were not significant.

{"abstract":"Proposals for air traffic management such as Free Flight call for a transfer of responsibility for separation between aircraft from air traffic controllers (ATCos) to pilots. Under many proposals, the role of the ATCo will change from one of active control to passive monitoring. The present study directly compared these types of control with respect to ATCo mental workload, conflict detection, and memory. Eighteen ATCos participated in an air traffic control simulation of Free Flight procedures under moderate and high traffic load. Dependent variables included accuracy and timeliness in detecting potential conflicts, accepting and handing off aircraft, mental workload (as assessed by a secondary task, heart rate variability, and subjective ratings), and memory for aircraft location. High traffic density and passive control both degraded conflict detection performance. Actual or potential applications of this research include the recommendation that designs for future air traffic management keep authority for separation of aircraft with the controller.

{"abstract":"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow a user to control a computer application by brain activity as measured, e.g., by electroencephalography (EEG). After about 30 years of BCI research, the success of control that is achieved by means of a BCI system still greatly varies between subjects. For about 20% of potential users the obtained accuracy does not reach the level criterion, meaning that BCI control is not accurate enough to control an application. The determination of factors that may serve to predict BCI performance, and the development of methods to quantify a predictor value from psychological and\/or physiological data serves two purposes: a better understanding of the 'BCI-illiteracy phenomenon', and avoidance of a costly and eventually frustrating training procedure for participants who might not obtain BCI control. Furthermore, such predictors may lead to approaches to antagonize BCI-illiteracy. Here, we propose a neurophysiological predictor of BCI performance which can be determined from a two minutes recording of a 'relax with eyes open' condition using two Laplacian EEG channels. A correlation of r = 0.53 between the proposed predictor and BCI feedback performance was obtained on a large data base with N = 80 BCI-naive participants in their first session with the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) system which operates on modulations of sensory motor rhythms (SMRs).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether inattentional deafness to critical alarms would be observed in a simulated cockpit. BACKGROUND: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. METHOD: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. RESULTS: In the windshear scenario, II pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. CONCLUSION: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety. Pre-exposure to a critical event triggering an auditory alarm can enhance alarm detection when a similar event is encountered subsequently. APPLICATION: Case-based learning is a solution to mitigate auditory alarm misperception.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of the present work was to examine the effects of mind state (mind-wandering vs. on-task) on driving performance in a high-fidelity driving simulator. BACKGROUND: Mind-wandering is thought to interfere with goal-directed thought. It is likely, then, that when driving, mind-wandering might lead to impairments in critical aspects of driving performance. In two experiments, we assess the extent to which mind-wandering interferes with responsiveness to sudden events, mean velocity, and headway distance. METHOD: Using a car-following procedure in a high-fidelity driving simulator, participants were probed at random times to indicate whether they were on-task at that moment or mind-wandering. The dependent measures were analyzed based on the participant's response to the probe. RESULTS: Compared to when on-task, when mind-wandering participants showed longer response times to sudden events, drove at a higher velocity, and maintained a shorter headway distance (close following). CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings indicate that mind-wandering affects a broad range of driving responses and may therefore lead to higher crash risk. APPLICATION: The results suggest that situations that are likely associated with mind-wandering (e.g., route familiarity) can impair driving performance.

{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a Pulse-Doppler radar system for in-home gait assessment of older adults. A methodology has been developed to extract gait parameters including walking speed and step time using Doppler radar. The gait parameters have been validated with a Vicon motion capture system in the lab with 13 participants and 158 test runs. The study revealed that for an optimal step recognition and walking speed estimation, a dual radar set up with one radar placed at foot level and the other at torso level is necessary. An excellent absolute agreement with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.97 was found for step time estimation with the foot level radar. For walking speed, although both radars show excellent consistency they all have a system offset compared to the ground truth due to walking direction with respect to the radar beam. The torso level radar has a better performance (9% offset on average) in the speed estimation compared to the foot level radar (13-18% offset). Quantitative analysis has been performed to compute the angles causing the systematic error. These lab results demonstrate the capability of the system to be used as a daily gait assessment tool in home environments, useful for fall risk assessment and other health care applications. The system is currently being tested in an unstructured home environment.

{"abstract":"Alcohol is a known exogenous modulator of negative affect (anxiety, tension) in both animals and humans. It has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala, an area critical to fear perception and responding. However, little is known about the acute effects of alcohol on amygdala reactivity to threatening information in humans. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well validated task to probe amygdala responses to social signals of threat in 12 healthy, social drinkers after a double-blind crossover administration of alcohol or placebo. We found that alcohol significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to threat signals. The current findings fit well with the notion that alcohol may attenuate threat-based responding and provide a potential brain-based mechanism for the link between alcohol and anxiety, and\/or social threat perception.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator study compared the effect of changes in workload on performance in manual and highly automated driving. Changes in driver state were also observed by examining variations in blink patterns. BACKGROUND: With the addition of a greater number of advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles, the driver's role is likely to alter in the future from an operator in manual driving to a supervisor of highly automated cars. Understanding the implications of such advancements on drivers and road safety is important. METHOD: A total of 50 participants were recruited for this study and drove the simulator in both manual and highly automated mode. As well as comparing the effect of adjustments in driving-related workload on performance, the effect of a secondary Twenty Questions Task was also investigated. RESULTS: In the absence of the secondary task, drivers' response to critical incidents was similar in manual and highly automated driving conditions. The worst performance was observed when drivers were required to regain control of driving in the automated mode while distracted by the secondary task. Blink frequency patterns were more consistent for manual than automated driving but were generally suppressed during conditions of high workload. CONCLUSION: Highly automated driving did not have a deleterious effect on driver performance, when attention was not diverted to the distracting secondary task.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated how human performance consequences of automated decision aids are affected by the degree of automation and the operator's functional state. BACKGROUND: As research has shown, decision aids may not only improve performance but also lead to new sorts of risks.Whereas knowledge exists about the impact of system characteristics (e.g., reliability) on human performance, little is known about how these performance consequences are moderated by the functional state of operators. METHOD: Participants performed a simulated supervisory process control task with one of two decision aids providing support for fault identification and management. One session took place during the day, and another one took place during the night after a prolonged waking phase of more than 20 hr. RESULTS: Results showed that decision aids can support humans effectively in maintaining high levels of performance, even in states of sleep loss, with more highly automated aids being more effective than less automated ones. Furthermore, participants suffering from sleep loss were found to be more careful in interaction with the aids, that is, less prone to effects of complacency and automation bias. However, cost effects arose that included a decline in secondary-task performance and an increased risk of return-to-manual performance decrements. CONCLUSION: Automation support can help protect performance after a period of extended wakefulness. In addition, operators suffering from sleep loss seem to compensate for their impaired functional state by reallocating resources and showing a more attentive behavior toward possible automation failures.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether continually updated information about a system's confidence in its ability to perform assigned tasks improves operators' trust calibration in, and use of, an automated decision support system (DSS). BACKGROUND: The introduction of decision aids often leads to performance breakdowns that are related to automation bias and trust miscalibration. This can be explained, in part, by the fact that operators are informed about overall system reliability only, which makes it impossible for them to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to follow the system's advice. METHOD: The application for this research was a neural net-based decision aid that assists pilots with detecting and handling in-flight icing encounters. A multifactorial experiment was carried out with two groups of 15 instructor pilots each flying a series of 28 approaches in a motion-base simulator. One group was informed about the system's overall reliability only, whereas the other group received updated system confidence information. RESULTS: Pilots in the updated group experienced significantly fewer icing-related stalls and were more likely to reverse their initial response to an icing condition when it did not produce desired results. Their estimate of the system's accuracy was more accurate than that of the fixed group.

{"abstract":"To determine if visual aging affects the ability to identify blurred text signs in daytime or nighttime viewing conditions, the photopic and mesopic legibility thresholds of young and old adult observers were compared at three levels of optically induced acuity (Experiment 1). For both age groups, legibility was reduced by nighttime luminance and degraded acuity. Surprisingly, older observers were better than younger ones in identifying defocused (optically blurred) text in both daytime and nighttime conditions. In Experiment 2, older observers were also superior to younger ones in identifying defocused standard and spatially matched novel text signs. These findings indicate that older observers' tolerance of optical blur is a generic ability, rather than one explained by familiarity with the low-pass optical profile of specific signs. Consistent with the notion that factors beyond acuity contribute more importantly to text legibility for older than for younger observers, acuity was a stronger predictor of legibility thresholds in the younger group. Actual or potential applications of this research include the need to consider functional acuity in visual screening protocols and the design of text displays, as well as the utilization of compensatory letter-recognition training for older observers or others with diminished acuity.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: I review and critique basic ideas of both traditional error\/risk analysis and the newer and contrasting paradigm of resilience engineering. BACKGROUND: Analysis of human error has matured and been applied over the past 50 years by human factors engineers, whereas the resilience engineering paradigm is relatively new. METHOD: Fundamental ideas and examples of human factors applications of each approach are presented and contrasted. RESULTS: Probabilistic risk analysis provides mathematical rigor in generalizing on past error events to identify system vulnerabilities, but prediction is problematical because (a) error definition is arbitrary, and thus it is difficult to infer valid probabilities of human error to input to quantitative models, and (b) future accident conditions are likely to be quite different from those of past accidents. The new resilience engineering paradigm, in contrast, is oriented toward organizational process and is concerned with anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for graceful recovery from future events. CONCLUSION: Resilience engineering complements traditional error analysis but has yet to provide useful quantification and operational methods.

{"abstract":"Given the increasingly dominant role of video games in the mainstream entertainment industry, it is no surprise that the scholarly debate about their impact has been lively and well attended. Although >100 studies have been conducted to examine the impact of violent video games on aggression, no clear consensus has been reached, particularly in terms of their long-term impact on violent behavior and aggressive cognitions. This study employs a first-ever longitudinal laboratory-based experiment to examine longer-term effects of playing a violent video game. One hundred thirty-five participants were assigned either to the treatment condition where they played a violent video game in a controlled laboratory setting for a total of 12 hours or to the control group where they did not play a game. Participants in the treatment group played Grand Theft Auto IV over a period of 3 weeks and were compared with a control group on the posttest measures of trait aggression, attitudes toward violence, and empathy. The findings do not support the assertion that playing a violent video game for a period of 3 weeks increases aggression or reduces empathy, but they suggest a small increase in proviolence attitudes. The implications of the findings are discussed. Language: en","authors":["Scott Kie Zin. Teng","Gabriel Yew Mun. Chong","Amy Sok Cheng. Siew","Marko M.

{"abstract":"Numerous recent studies have examined the impact of video gaming on various dependent variables, including the players' affective reactions, positive as well as detrimental cognitive effects, and real-world aggression. These target variables are typically analyzed as a function of game characteristics and player attributes-especially gender. However, findings on the uneven distribution of gaming experience between males and females, on the one hand, and the effect of gaming experience on several target variables, on the other hand, point at a possible confound when gaming experiments are analyzed with a standard analysis of variance. This study uses simulated data to exemplify analysis of regression residuals as a potentially beneficial data analysis strategy for such datasets. As the actual impact of gaming experience on each of the various dependent variables differs, the ultimate benefits of analysis of regression residuals entirely depend on the research question, but it offers a powerful statistical approach to video game research whenever gaming experience is a confounding factor.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether the stress reduction effects of phased training culminating in repeated exposure to a stressful scenario generalize to new scenarios. BACKGROUND: High-reliability occupations require personnel to operate in stressful situations involving complex environments, high degrees of uncertainty and time pressure, and severe consequences for mistakes. One method of training for such environments culminates in practice in high-fidelity, highly stressful simulations. For some domains, realism necessitates large-scale, difficult-to-modify physical simulations. This necessity often results in repeated exposure to one or very few scenarios. The literature gives reason to question whether the stress reduction effects of such exposure transfer to new scenarios. METHOD: Anxiety and cognitive difficulties were measured among firefighter trainees during three live-fire drills. For each trainee, two drills involved the same scenario, and the other involved a new scenario that was structurally similar to the repeated scenario. RESULTS: As predicted, anxiety and cognitive difficulties decreased across repetitions of the same scenario. However, the reduction did not generalize to a new scenario, and a nontrivial portion of the sample showed signs of negative transfer. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to the same stressful scenario as the final phase of training has limited practical value for stress reduction. Methods for expanding the range of scenarios to which trainees are exposed or for increasing the value of the exposure are recommended. APPLICATION: The findings could help improve design of training programs for high-reliability occupations. Language: en","authors":["Michael R. Baumann","Carol L. Gohm","Bryan L.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate use patterns among early adopters of adaptive cruise control (ACC). BACKGROUND: Extended use ofACC may influence a driver's behavior in the long-term, which can have unintended safety consequences. METHOD: The authors examined the use of a motion-based simulator by 24 participants (15 males and 9 females). Cluster analysis was performed on drivers' use of ACC and was based on their gap settings, speed settings, number of warnings issued, and ACC disengaged. The data were then examined on the basis of driving performance measures and drivers' subjective responses to trust in ACC, understanding of system operations, and driving styles. Driving performance measures included minimum time headway, adjusted minimum time to collision, and drivers' reaction time to critical events. RESULTS: Three groups of drivers were observed on the basis of risky behavior, moderately risky behavior, and conservative behavior. Drivers in the conservative group stayed farther behind the lead vehicle than did drivers in the other two groups. Risky drivers responded later to critical events and had more ACC warnings issued. CONCLUSION: Safety consequences with ACC may be more prevalent in some driver groups than others. The findings suggest that these safety implications are related to trust in automation, driving styles, understanding of system operations, and personalities. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include enhanced design for next-generation ACC systems and countermeasures to improve safe driving with ACC.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated five contextual variables that we hypothesized would influence driver acceptance of alerts to pedestrians issued by a night vision active safety system to inform the specification of the system's alerting strategies. BACKGROUND: Driver acceptance of automotive active safety systems is a key factor to promote their use and implies a need to assess factors influencing driver acceptance. METHOD: In a field operational test, 10 drivers drove instrumented vehicles equipped with a preproduction night vision system with pedestrian detection software. In a follow-up experiment, the 10 drivers and 25 additional volunteers without experience with the system watched 57 clips with pedestrian encounters gathered during the field operational test. They rated the acceptance of an alert to each pedestrian encounter. RESULTS: Levels of rating concordance were significant between drivers who experienced the encounters and participants who did not. Two contextual variables, pedestrian location and motion, were found to influence ratings. Alerts were more accepted when pedestrians were close to or moving toward the vehicle's path. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the utility of using subjective driver acceptance ratings to inform the design of active safety systems and to leverage expensive field operational test data within the confines of the laboratory. APPLICATION: The design of alerting strategies for active safety systems needs to heed the driver's contextual sensitivity to issued alerts.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The authors discuss empirical studies of human-automation interaction and their implications for automation design. BACKGROUND: Automation is prevalent in safety-critical systems and increasingly in everyday life. Many studies of human performance in automated systems have been conducted over the past 30 years. METHODS: Developments in three areas are examined: levels and stages of automation, reliance on and compliance with automation, and adaptive automation. RESULTS: Automation applied to information analysis or decision-making functions leads to differential system performance benefits and costs that must be considered in choosing appropriate levels and stages of automation. Human user dependence on automated alerts and advisories reflects two components of operator trust, reliance and compliance, which are in turn determined by the threshold designers use to balance automation misses and false alarms. Finally, adaptive automation can provide additional benefits in balancing workload and maintaining the user's situation awareness, although more research is required to identify when adaptation should be user controlled or system driven. CONCLUSIONS: The past three decades of empirical research on humans and automation has provided a strong science base that can be used to guide the design of automated systems.

{"abstract":"Consuming an unhealthy level of alcohol is a significant problem for some young women. Potential determinants of excess consumption include perceptions of usual consumption among peers-perceptions of what is \"normal.\" The present study examined whether perceptions of social normative endorsement of drinking, operationalized by measures of perceived alcohol consumption of close friends (proximal norms), the consumption of the \"average student\" (distal norms), and the extent of alcohol-related content posted by peers on Facebook were related to alcohol-related attitudes and self-reported consumption. Female university students (n=129; Mage=21.48 years, SD=3.00) completed an online questionnaire assessing Facebook use, perceived alcohol-related norms, and self-reported alcohol attitudes and consumption. Perceptions of the consumption of the average female student were a negative predictor of attitudes. Positive alcohol attitudes, extent of own alcohol-related photographic posts on Facebook, average female student alcohol consumption, and report of male close friend consumption predicted self-report of own alcohol consumption. Interestingly, female close friend norms failed to predict consumption, whereas male close friend norms predicted consumption but not attitudes, suggesting the possibility of separate cognitive pathways for alcohol-related attitudes and behavior. This study builds on existing research by casting new light on predictors of alcohol-related attitudes, as well as describing the potential role of social networking sites such as Facebook in the formation of social norms and the modulation of drinking behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the way in which the type and preexisting strength of association between an auditory icon and a warning event affects the ease with which the icon\/event pairing can be learned and retained. BACKGROUND: To be effective, an auditory warning must be audible, identifiable, interpretable, and heeded. Warnings consisting of familiar environmental sounds, or auditory icons, have potential to facilitate identification and interpretation. The ease with which pairings between auditory icons and warning events can be learned and retained is likely to depend on the type and strength of the preexisting icon\/event association. METHOD: Sixty-three participants each learned eight auditory-icon\/denotative-referent pairings and attempted to recall them 4 weeks later. Three icon\/denotative-referent association types (direct, related, and unrelated) were employed. Participants rated the strength of the association for each pairing on a 7-point scale. RESULTS: The number of errors made while learning pairings was greater for unrelated than for either related or direct associations, whereas the number of errors made while attempting to recall pairings 4 weeks later was greater for unrelated than for related associations and for related than for direct associations. Irrespective of association type, both learning and retention performance remained at very high levels, provided the strength of the association was rated greater than 5. CONCLUSION: This suggests that strong preexisting associations are used to facilitate learning and retention of icon\/denotative-referent pairings. APPLICATION: The practical implication of this study is that auditory icons having either direct or strong, indirect associations with warning events should be preferred.

{"abstract":"Theoretical models and experimental evidence suggest that cortico-striatal-cerebellar networks play a crucial role in mediating motor sequence learning. However, how these different regions interact in order to mediate learning is less clear. In the present fMRI study, we used dynamic causal modeling to investigate effective connectivity within the cortico-striatal-cerebellar network while subjects performed a serial reaction time task. Using Bayesian model selection and family wise inference, we show that the cortico-cerebellar loop had higher model evidence than the cortico-striatal loop during motor learning. We observed significant negative modulatory effects on the connections from M1 to cerebellum bilaterally during learning. The results suggest that M1 causes the observed decrease in activity in the cerebellum as learning progresses. The current study stresses the significant role that the cerebellum plays in motor learning as previously suggested by fMRI studies in healthy subjects as well as behavioral studies in patients with cerebellar dysfunction. These results provide important insight into the neural mechanisms underlying motor learning. Language: en","authors":["Elinor Tzvi","Thomas F. M\u00fcnte","Ulrike M.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effects of a PC-based training program on risk perception in a driving simulator. BACKGROUND: Novice drivers have a fatality rate some eight times higher than that of the most experienced group of drivers, primarily because of the novice driver's inability to predict ahead of time the risks that will appear in the roadway. Current driver education programs, at least those in the United States, do not emphasize the teaching of risk awareness skills to novice drivers. METHOD: A PC-based risk awareness and perception training program was developed and evaluated. The training involved using plan (top-down) views of 10 risky scenarios that helped novice drivers identify where potential risks were located and what information should be attended. Both the 24 trained novice drivers and 24 untrained novice drivers were evaluated on an advanced driving simulator. The eye movements of both groups of drivers were measured. The evaluation on the driving simulator included both scenarios used in the training and others not used in training. RESULTS: The set of trained novice drivers were almost twice as likely as untrained drivers to fixate appropriately either on the regions where potential risks might appear or on signs that warned of potentially risky situations ahead, both for the scenarios they had encountered in training and for novel scenarios. APPLICATION: The PC training program developed, which is portable and can be widely used, has great promise in improving risk perception for novice drivers on the road.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to enable the head-up monitoring of two interrelated aircraft navigation instruments by developing a 3-D auditory display that encodes this navigation information within two spatially discrete sonifications. BACKGROUND: Head-up monitoring of aircraft navigation information utilizing 3-D audio displays, particularly involving concurrently presented sonifications, requires additional research. METHOD: A flight simulator's head-down waypoint bearing and course deviation instrument readouts were conveyed to participants via a 3-D auditory display. Both readouts were separately represented by a colocated pair of continuous sounds, one fixed and the other varying in pitch, which together encoded the instrument value's deviation from the norm. Each sound pair's position in the listening space indicated the left\/right parameter of its instrument's readout. Participants' accuracy in navigating a predetermined flight plan was evaluated while performing a head-up task involving the detection of visual flares in the out-of-cockpit scene. RESULTS: The auditory display significantly improved aircraft heading and course deviation accuracy, head-up time, and flare detections. Head tracking did not improve performance by providing participants with the ability to orient potentially conflicting sounds, suggesting that the use of integrated localizing cues was successful. CONCLUSION: A supplementary 3-D auditory display enabled effective head-up monitoring of interrelated navigation information normally attended to through a head-down display. APPLICATION: Pilots operating aircraft, such as helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, may benefit from a supplementary auditory display because they navigate in two dimensions while performing head-up, out-of-aircraft, visual tasks.

Diffusion tensor imaging provides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent and nature of structural injury, but has been limited by examining only a subset of regions of interest (ROI) and by confounds common to the study of an elderly population, including comorbid vascular pathology. Furthermore, comprehensive correlation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements, including axial and radial diffusivity measurements, has not been demonstrated in the late life depression population. METHODS: 51 depressed and 16 non-depressed, age- and cerebrovascular risk factor-matched elderly subjects underwent traditional anatomic T1 and T2 weight imaging, as well as DTI. The DTI data were skeletonized using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), and both regional and global analyses were performed. RESULTS: Widespread structural abnormalities within white matter were detected in the LLD group, accounting for age, gender and education and matched for cerebrovascular risk factors and global T2 white matter hyperintensities (T2WMH). Regional differences were most prominent in uncinate and cingulate white matter and were generally characterized by an increase in radial diffusivity. Age-related changes particularly in the cingulate bundle were more advanced in individuals with LLD relative to controls. Regression analysis demonstrated significant correlations of regional fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity with five different neuropsychological factor scores. TBSS analysis demonstrated a greater extent of white matter abnormalities in LLD not responsive to treatment, as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: White matter integrity is compromised in late life depression, largely manifested by increased radial diffusivity in specific regions, suggesting underlying myelin injury. A possible mechanism for underlying myelin injury is chronic white matter ischemia related to intrinsic cerebrovascular disease. In some regions such as the cingulate bundle, the white matter injury related to late life depression appears to be independent of and compounded by age-related changes. The correlations with neuropsychological testing indicate the essential effects of white matter injury on functional status. Lastly, response to treatment may depend on the extent of white matter injury, suggesting a need for intact functional networks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether teaming up mitigates individual vulnerability to task interruptions in complex dynamic situations. BACKGROUND: Omnipresent in everyday multitasking environments, task interruptions are usually detrimental to individual performance. This is particularly crucial in dynamic command and control (C2) safety-critical contexts because of the additional challenge imposed by the continually evolving situation during the interruption. METHOD: We employed a firefighting microworld to simulate C2 in the context of supervisory control to examine the relative impact of interruptions on participants working in a functional dyad versus operators working alone. RESULTS: Although task interruption was detrimental to participants' efficacy of monitoring resources, the negative impact of interruption was reduced for those working in teams. Teaming up translated into faster resumption time, but only if both teammates were interrupted simultaneously. Interrupting only one team member was associated with increased postinterruption communications and slower resumption time. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that in complex dynamic situations working in a small team confers more resistance to task interruption than working alone by virtue of the reduced individual workload typical of teamwork. The benefit of collaborative work seems nevertheless mediated by the coordination and communication overhead associated with teamwork. APPLICATION: The present findings have practical implications for operators dealing with unexpected events such as task interruptions in C2 environments.

{"abstract":"In this work, we argue that system accident literacy and safety competence should be an essential part of the intellectual toolkit of all engineering students. We discuss why such competence should be taught and nurtured in engineering students, and provide one example for how this can be done. We first define the class of adverse events of interest as system accidents, distinct from occupational accidents, through their (1) temporal depth of causality and (2) diversity of agency or groups and individuals who influence or contribute to the accident occurrence\/prevention. We then address the question of why the interest in this class of events and their prevention, and we expand on the importance of system safety literacy and the contributions that engineering students can make in the long-term towards accident prevention. Finally, we offer one model for an introductory course on accident causation and system safety, discuss the course logistics, material and delivery, and our experience teaching this subject. The course starts with the anatomy of accidents and is grounded in various case studies; these help illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of the subject, and provide the students with the important concepts to describe the phenomenology of accidents (e.g., initiating events, accident precursor or lead indicator, and accident pathogen). More importantly, the case studies invite a deep reflection on the underlying failure mechanisms, their generalizability, and the various safety levers for accident prevention. The course then proceeds to an exposition of defense-in-depth, safety barriers and principles, essential elements for an education in accident prevention, and it concludes with a presentation of basic concepts and tools for uncertainty and risk analysis. Educators will recognize the difficulties in designing a new course on such a broad subject. It is hoped that this work will invite comments and contributions from the readers, and that the journal will support the publication of exchanges on this subject. Language: en","authors":["Joseph H.

{"abstract":"The present research investigated the possibility of using an in-vehicle voice agent to promote eco-driving. Considering that both types of benefit appeals--egoistic (emphasizing benefits to the self) and altruistic (emphasizing benefits to others)--could be employed to promote eco-driving behavior, we explored the effects of benefit appeals delivered by an in-vehicle voice agent on driving performance. In particular, we tested whether and how the valence (positive vs. negative) of drivers' affective states moderates the effects, drawing on the functionalist affect-cognition framework, which has theorized that positive affect leads people to focus more on self-interest, whereas negative affect leads people to become more sensitive to social norms. An experiment was conducted in which participants, after undergoing affect (happy vs. sad) elicitation, received messages (egoistic vs. altruistic) promoting eco-driving from an in-vehicle voice agent while performing a simulated driving task. RESULTS were partially consistent with the functionalist affect-cognition framework. Happy participants performed better on eco-driving when they were exposed to egoistic appeals than to altruistic appeals. On the other hand, the driving performance data from sad participants did not yield a significant difference between the egoistic condition and the altruistic condition. Participants' driving performance data further revealed that the joint effects of benefit appeals and affective states on safe driving performance mirrored the joint effects on eco-driving performance, confirming a close relationship between the two driving behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of in-vehicle voice agents and benefit appeals in promoting eco-driving and safe driving are discussed.

{"abstract":"In urban areas, the occurrence of disasters can cause extensive damage to human society. For this reason, evacuation, regarded as a critical course of action to relocate people and property, helps to alleviate loss of life and property to a great extent. Risk associated with evacuation is an abstract concept that cannot be easily conceptualized. This paper develops a model for assessing and visualizing the risks associated with the evacuation process in response to potential catastrophes. Understanding of evacuation risk, the potential for losing transport connections and the difficulty of transferring rescue resources, was previously limited by considering pre-disaster factors only. This study mitigates such limitation by extending previous research to include the contingent post-disaster factors that have received scant attention to date. Two contingent post-disaster factors: the spatial impact of the disaster and the potential for traffic congestion caused by the evacuee routing behaviors, are discussed in detail and integrated into the model along with other pre-disaster factors. A case study on the transportation network of Beijing, China is used to demonstrate the value of the model. This paper asserts that the notion of evacuation risk is not a static evaluation of such factors as road vulnerability; rather it involves a dynamic process where contingent factors associated with disastrous events play a role. This model can help city emergency planners to identify urban infrastructures that may hinder an efficient evacuation process because of their deficient configuration.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether communicating automation uncertainty improves the driver-automation interaction. BACKGROUND: A false system understanding of infallibility may provoke automation misuse and can lead to severe consequences in case of automation failure. The presentation of automation uncertainty may prevent this false system understanding and, as was shown by previous studies, may have numerous benefits. Few studies, however, have clearly shown the potential of communicating uncertainty information in driving. The current study fills this gap. METHOD: We conducted a driving simulator experiment, varying the presented uncertainty information between participants (no uncertainty information vs. uncertainty information) and the automation reliability (high vs.low) within participants. Participants interacted with a highly automated driving system while engaging in secondary tasks and were required to cooperate with the automation to drive safely. RESULTS: Quantile regressions and multilevel modeling showed that the presentation of uncertainty information increases the time to collision in the case of automation failure. Furthermore, the data indicated improved situation awareness and better knowledge of fallibility for the experimental group. Consequently, the automation with the uncertainty symbol received higher trust ratings and increased acceptance. CONCLUSION: The presentation of automation uncertaintythrough a symbol improves overall driver-automation cooperation. APPLICATION: Most automated systems in driving could benefit from displaying reliability information. This display might improve the acceptance of fallible systems and further enhances driver-automation cooperation.

{"abstract":"This study was conducted to explore the lifestyles of online game players who have adopted the virtual world as part of their life. An online survey was conducted on players of an Internet-based game, Lineage. Lineage is the largest online game where people assume new identities and play various roles in a virtual environment, accommodating over 6 million users worldwide. A total of 4,786 game players participated in this survey, and their lifestyles were compared with their values and attitudes in the virtual world. Upon classification of their real-world lifestyles, their tendencies and desires were compared to lifestyles in the virtual world. This study showed that game players have developed their own distinctive lifestyles, and their lifestyles were a strong criterion for explaining behavior patterns and desires in the virtual world. Lifestyles were classified into three general categories: (1) single-oriented player, (2) community-oriented player, and (3) off-Real world player. Each group displayed distinct differences in their values and game activities, as well as in their anti-social behavior tendencies. The differences reflected not only their personality but also their socio-economic status within the virtual world, which is constructed through game activities. This study serves as a model to understand how players from different real-life backgrounds will behave in various game features and how they adopt the virtual world for their new social identities.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Analyses of novel linguistic and grammatical features, extracted from transcribed speech of people working in a collaborative environment, were performed for cognitive load measurement BACKGROUND: Prior studies have attempted to assess users' cognitive load with several measures, but most of them are intrusive and disrupt normal task flow. An effective measurement of people's cognitive load can help improve their performance by deploying appropriate output and support strategies accordingly. METHODS: The authors studied 33 members of bushfire management teams working collaboratively in computerized incident control rooms and involved in complex bushfire management tasks. The participants' communication was analyzed for some novel linguistic features as potential indices of cognitive load, which included sentence length, use of agreement and disagreement phrases, and use of personal pronouns, including both singular and plural pronoun types. RESULTS: Results showed users' different linguistic and grammatical patterns with various cognitive load levels. Specifically, with high load, people spoke more and used longer sentences, used more words that indicated disagreement with other team members, and exhibited increased use of plural personal pronouns and decreased use of singular pronouns. CONCLUSION: The article provides encouraging evidence for the use of linguistic and grammatical analysis for measuring users' cognitive load and proposes some novel features as cognitive load indices. APPLICATION: The proposed approach may be applied to many data-intense and safety-critical task scenarios, such as emergency management departments, for example, bushfire or traffic incident management centers; air traffic control rooms; and call centers, where speech is used as part of everyday tasks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We describe major discoveries and developments in vigilance research. BACKGROUND: Vigilance tasks have typically been viewed as undemanding assignments requiring little mental effort. The vigilance decrement function has also been considered to result from a decline in arousal brought about by understimulation. METHODS: Recent research in vigilance is reviewed in four areas: studies of task type, perceived mental workload during vigilance, neural measures of resource demand in vigilance, and studies of task-induced stress. RESULTS: Experiments comparing successive and simultaneous vigilance tasks support an attentional resource theory of vigilance. Subjective reports also show that the workload of vigilance is high and sensitive to factors that increase processing demands. Neuroimaging studies using transcranial Doppler sonography provide strong, independent evidence for resource changes linked to performance decrement in vigilance tasks. Finally, physiological and subjective reports confirm that vigilance tasks reduce task engagement and increase distress and that these changes rise with increased task difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: Converging evidence using behavioral, neural, and subjective measures shows that vigilance requires hard mental work and is stressful.

{"abstract":"Jill Palzkill Woelfer discusses vulnerability, susceptibility, and more than six years of research with homeless young people. In the US government and international organization documents, vulnerability has been assigned to groups as diverse as pregnant women, children, prisoners, students, employees, members of the armed forces or police, nursing home residents, people receiving welfare benefits or social assistance, other poor people, the unemployed, patients, some ethnic and racial minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, politically powerless individuals, and people unfamiliar with modern medical concepts. Identifying all these groups as vulnerable may help to frame research that is less likely to cause harm to participants. Once homeless, a young person may be further harmed by persistent negative experiences with institutions such as police and the court system, by violence, or by the situational exacerbation of mental illness or substance abuse, and so on. Harm may also arise through societal factors such as stigmatization and stereotyping.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A model of conflict judgments in air traffic control (ATC) is proposed. BACKGROUND: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt(o) is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt(h) is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt(v) is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1000 feet. METHODS: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. RESULTS: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N=161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N=88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. CONCLUSION: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether spatialized nonspeech beacons could guide navigation and how sound timbre, waypoint capture radius, and practice affect performance. BACKGROUND: Auditory displays may assist mobility and wayfinding for those with temporary or permanent visual impairment, but they remain understudied. Previous systems have used speech-based interfaces. METHOD: Participants (108 undergraduates) navigated three maps, guided by one of three beacons (pink noise, sonar ping, or 1000-Hz pure tone) spatialized by a virtual reality engine. Dependent measures were efficiency of time and path length. RESULTS: Overall navigation was very successful, with significant effects of practice and capture radius, and interactions with beacon sound. Overshooting and subsequent hunting for waypoints was exacerbated for small radius conditions. A human-scale capture radius (1.5 m) and sonar-like beacon yielded the optimal combination for safety and efficiency. CONCLUSION: The selection of beacon sound and capture radius depend on the specific application, including whether speed of travel or adherence to path are of primary concern. Extended use affects sound preferences and quickly leads to improvements in both speed and accuracy. APPLICATION: These findings should lead to improved wayfinding systems for the visually impaired as well as for first responders (e.g., firefighters) and soldiers. Language: en","authors":["Bruce N.

{"abstract":"In 2 experiments, a 12-min computerized vigilance task was demonstrated to reproduce the vigilance decrement, high workload (NASA-TLX), and stressful character (Dundee Stress State Questionnaire) of vigilance tasks lasting 30 min or more. In Experiment 1, the abbreviated task was also shown to duplicate the signal salience effect, a major finding associated with long-duration vigilance tasks. Moreover, Experiment 2 showed that performance on the abbreviated task can be enhanced by caffeine - a drug that benefits long-duration tasks. This enhancement effect was limited to performance, however, suggesting that caffeine influences factors that control signal detection but not those that control task-induced stress. The results parallel those obtained with long-duration tasks and support a resource-depletion model of the vigilance decrement. The abbreviated task might be useful in situations in which long-duration tasks are precluded (e.g., performance assessment batteries, neuropsychological testing, and brain imaging).

{"abstract":"Recent animal studies have suggested that cortical areas may play a greater role in the modulation of abnormal oscillatory activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) than previously recognized. We investigated task and medication-dependent, EEG-based directional cortical connectivity in the \u03b8 (4-7 Hz), \u03b1 (8-12 Hz), \u03b2 (13-30 Hz) and low \u03b3 (31-50 Hz) frequency bands in 10 PD subjects and 10 age-matched controls. All subjects performed a visually guided task previously shown to modulate abnormal oscillatory activity in PD subjects. We examined the connectivity in the simultaneously-recorded EEG between 5 electrode regions of interest (Fronto-Central, Left and Right Sensorimotor, Central and Occipital) using a sparse, multivariate, autoregressive-based partial directed coherence method. For comparison, we utilized traditional Fourier analysis to evaluate task-dependent frequency spectra modulation in these same regions. While the spectral analysis revealed some overall differences between PD and control subjects, it demonstrated relatively modest changes between regions. In contrast, the partial directed coherence-based analysis revealed multifaceted, regionally and directionally-dependent alterations of connectivity in PD subjects during both movement preparation and execution. Connectivity was particularly altered posteriorly, suggesting abnormalities in visual and visuo-motor processing in PD. Moreover, connectivity measures in the \u03b1, \u03b2 and low \u03b3 frequency ranges correlated with motor Unified Parkinson\u201fs Disease Rating Scores in PD subjects withdrawn from medication. Levodopa administration only partially restored connectivity, and in some cases resulted in further exacerbation of abnormalities. Our results support the notion that PD is associated with significant alterations in connectivity between brain regions, and that these changes can be non-invasively detected in the EEG using partial directed coherence methods. Thus, the role of EEG to monitor PD may need to be further expanded. Language: en","authors":["G. Tropini","Joyce Chiang","Z. Jane Wang","Edna Ty","Martin J.

{"abstract":"We examined whether older and younger adults share a schema for taking medication and whether instructions are better recalled when they are organized to match this schema. Experiment 1 examined age difference in schema organization. Participants sorted medication items (e.g., purpose, dose, possible side effects) according to similarity and then ordered the items to create a preferred instruction set. Cluster analysis of the sort and order data showed that younger and older adults share a schema for taking medication. Secondary regression analyses found that verbal ability (i.e., vocabulary scores) predicted individual differences in schema organization. In Experiment 2 participants recalled instructions that were either compatible with this schema in terms of grouping and order of items or were presented in nonpreferred orders. Younger participants remembered more information than did older participants, but both age groups better remembered and preferred the more schema-compatible instructions. Secondary analyses showed that recall was also positively related to verbal ability. Along with our earlier research, this study suggests that older and younger adults possess a schema for taking medication and that instructions that are compatible with this schema provide an environmental support that improves memory for medication information.

{"abstract":"The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) of locusts is a visual interneuron that responds with an increasing spike frequency to an object approaching on a direct collision course. Recent studies involving the use of LGMD models to detect car collisions showed that it could detect collisions, but the neuron produced collision alerts to non-colliding, translating, stimuli in many cases. This study presents a modified model to address these problems. It shows how the neurons pre-synaptic to the LGMD show a remarkable ability to filter images, and only colliding and translating stimuli produce excitation in the neuron. It then integrates the LGMD network with models based on the elementary movement detector (EMD) neurons from the fly visual system, which are used to analyse directional excitation patterns in the biologically filtered images. Combining the information from the LGMD neuron and four directionally sensitive neurons produces a robust collision detection system for a wide range of automotive test situations.

{"abstract":"Problems related to fire hazard and fire management have become in recent decades one of the most relevant issues in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), that is the area where human infrastructures meet or intermingle with natural vegetation. In this paper we develop a robust geospatial method for defining and mapping the WUI in the Alpine environment, where most interactions between infrastructures and wildland vegetation concern the fire ignition through human activities, whereas no significant threats exist for infrastructures due to contact with burning vegetation. We used the three Alpine Swiss cantons of Ticino, Valais and Grisons as the study area. The features representing anthropogenic infrastructures (urban or infrastructural components of the WUI) as well as forest cover related features (wildland component of the WUI) were selected from the Swiss Topographic Landscape Model (TLM3D). Georeferenced forest fire occurrences derived from the WSL Swissfire database were used to define suitable WUI interface distances. The Random Forest algorithm was applied to estimate the importance of predictor variables to fire ignition occurrence. This revealed that buildings and drivable roads are the most relevant anthropogenic components with respect to fire ignition. We consequently defined the combination of drivable roads and easily accessible (i.e. 100 m from the next drivable road) buildings as the WUI-relevant infrastructural component. For the definition of the interface (buffer) distance between WUI infrastructural and wildland components, we computed the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the percentage of ignition points (observed and simulated) arising at increasing distances from the selected infrastructures. The ECDF facilitates the calculation of both the distance at which a given percentage of ignition points occurred and, in turn, the amount of forest area covered at a given distance. Finally, we developed a GIS ModelBuilder routine to map the WUI for the selected buffer distance. The approach was found to be reproducible, robust (based on statistical analyses for evaluating parameters) and flexible (buffer distances depending on the targeted final area covered) so that fire managers may use it to detect WUI according to their specific priorities.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated speech, environmental sounds (naturally occurring sounds with arbitrary meanings), auditory icons (natural or synthetic sounds with specific meanings), and abstract synthetic warnings as candidates for within-vehicle interfaces. BACKGROUND: Auditory displays and warnings must satisfy certain criteria, such as being appropriately urgent and commanding appropriately fast response times. However, a semiotic analysis suggests that displays, as signals interpreted by users, should also be mapped successfully onto their referents. METHOD: Response times and accuracy were recorded in a computer task of identifying learned mappings of candidate displays to a range of referent driving events (such as\"headway closing\"); perceived urgency and pleasantness were assessed separately. RESULTS: Speech and auditory icons produced near-ceiling performance in response times and identification accuracy. Abstract sounds produced notably slower response times and less accuracy. Environmental sounds showed an intermediate pattern of performance for accuracy, but the response times were similar to those of the abstract sounds. Speech utterances were similarly and consistently rated as pleasant but also of intermediate perceived urgency. The three other sound types showed a consistent mapping of their perceived urgency to the situational urgency of their referents; for these sounds, perceived urgency and pleasantness were negatively correlated. CONCLUSION: The results point to the importance of considering the role of signal-referent relationships in designing auditory displays. APPLICATION: The results have applicability for auditory displays in the vehicle interface, whereas the theoretical framework is of value in auditory display design in a broader context.

{"abstract":"Decrements in the proportion of signals detected over time on task and large individual differences in performance are typical findings in studies of vigilance. This study investigates the effects of signal probability on individual differences in vigilance performance. Participants monitored stimulus events on computer displays over 2-h periods at three signal probability levels (.01, .04, & .12). Results were analyzed between groups, within groups, and within subjects. Detection decrements were found to be inversely related to signal probability levels across groups. High signal probabilities generated consistent within-group and within-subject performance, whereas low probabilities generated both lower performance and larger within-subject variance. This relationship between signal probability and within-group and within-subject variance has not been previously demonstrated. Future investigations should focus on the sources of both between-subjects and within-subject variation in vigilance performance in order to identify optimal interventions. Actual or potential applications include designing work to minimize vigilance decrement and maximize human performance under conditions that require sustained attention.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: An experiment investigated the efficacy of auditory icons as warning signals in an aviation context. BACKGROUND: Iconic signals, such as a cough to signal dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, convey information about the nature of an incident and alert the operator that there is a problem, whereas signals that are arbitrarily associated with a critical incident provide relatively less information. Warning recognition speed and accuracy are likely to be influenced by modality of presentation (visual, auditory, auditory + visual) and task demand (low, high). METHODS: The 172 participants completed a computer-based training session and test task that involved responding to abstract or iconic auditory (1 s), visual, or auditory + visual warnings associated with seven critical incidents while performing low- and high-demand concurrent tasks. RESULTS: Significantly fewer training trials were required to learn iconic warnings than abstract warnings. An advantage for iconic warnings persisted into the test phase, evident most consistently as greater warning recognition accuracy. The effect was observed in both high- and low-demand conditions. Auditory abstract warnings, in particular, elicited slow reaction times and poor accuracy. CONCLUSION: Associations between a small number of meaningful environmental sounds and critical incidents can be learned with ease relative to more abstract associations, although training is required and response times are relatively slow. APPLICATION: Sets of distinctive auditory iconic warnings can be designed to alert and inform pilots about non-time-pressured events.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether anesthesia residents (physicians in training) performed clinical duties in the operating room differently during the day versus at night. BACKGROUND: Fatigue from sleep deprivation and working through the night is common for physicians, particularly during residency training. METHODS: Using a repeated-measures design, we studied 13 pairs of day-night matched anesthesia cases. Dependent measures included task times, workload ratings, response to an alarm light latency task, and mood. RESULTS: Residents spent significantly less time on manual tasks and more time on monitoring tasks during the maintenance phase at night than during the day. Residents reported more negative mood at night than during the day, both pre- and postoperation. However, time of day had no effect on the mood change between pre- and postoperation. Workload ratings and the response time to an alarm light latency task were not significantly different between night and day cases. CONCLUSIONS: Because night shift residents had been awake and working for more than 16 hr, the observed differences in task performance and mood may be attributed to fatigue. The changes in task distribution during night shift work may represent compensatory strategies to maintain patient care quality while keeping perceived workload at a manageable level. APPLICATIONS: Fatigue effects during night shifts should be considered when designing work-rest schedules for clinicians. This matched-case control scheme can also be applied to study other phenomena associated with patient safety in the actual clinical environment. Language: en","authors":["Caroline G. L.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether elderly individuals underestimate the time that it will take them to cross a street by comparing estimated with actual road-crossing time. BACKGROUND: In many developed countries, elderly people are overrepresented among pedestrian fatalities from motor vehicle accidents. There is surely more than one contributing factor to this phenomenon, and many have been offered. We propose that one additional factor may be that although older people are consciously aware that they no longer walk at the same pace as they once did, they do not take this fact into consideration when planning a street crossing. METHOD: We compared the ability of young and old pedestrians to estimate the time that it will take them to cross a street, using both prospective and retrospective time estimation. RESULTS: A significant interaction was found between age group and crossing time. Among elderly participants, actual crossing times were significantly longer than both their precrossing estimation and their postcrossing estimation, which did not significantly differ from each other. In contrast, the undergraduate group's crossing times did not display a significant difference across measurements. CONCLUSION: This study implies that even if older pedestrians correctly evaluate the road situation, they may nonetheless endanger themselves by underestimating the time that it will take them to cross the street.We suggest that minimizing this effect could be accomplished by educating seniors to the fact that they are not as fast as they once were and that this fact needs to be factored in to street-crossing decisions.

While discussion-based parental mediation was found to be negatively related to young adolescents' befriending strangers in SNSs, it did not reduce privacy risks. FINDINGS also suggested that peer influence could result in undesirable outcomes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Shooter accuracy and stability were monitored while firing two bullpup and two conventional configuration rifles of the same caliber in order to determine if one style of weapon results in superior performance. BACKGROUND: Considerable debate exists among police and military professionals regarding the differences between conventional configuration weapons, where the magazine and action are located ahead of the trigger, and bullpup configuration, where they are located behind the trigger (closer to the user). To date, no published research has attempted to evaluate this question from a physical ergonomics standpoint, and the knowledge that one style might improve stability or result in superior performance is of interest to countless military, law enforcement, and industry experts. METHOD: A live-fire evaluation of both weapon styles was performed using a total of 48 participants. Shooting accuracy and fluctuations in biomechanical stability (center of pressure) were monitored while subjects used the weapons to perform standard drills. RESULTS: The bullpup weapon designs were found to provide a significant advantage in accuracy and shooter stability, while subjects showed considerable preference toward the conventional weapons. CONCLUSION: Although many mechanical and maintenance issues must be considered before committing to a bullpup or conventional weapon system, it is clear in terms of basic human stability that the bullpup is the more advantageous configuration.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of head movement frequency and predictive compensation on (a) latency produced in a monocular see-through helmet-mounted display (HMD) test bed and (b) simulator sickness experienced by users wearing the HMD. BACKGROUND: There is conflicting research regarding latency as a significant factor in the onset of simulator sickness. Predictive compensation has been shown to mitigate the magnitude of latency, but little is known about the extent of its effect on simulator sickness. METHOD: A video camera recorded HMD and simulator imagery to accurately measure apparent latency produced at three head movement frequencies. Predictive compensation strategies were manipulated to measure the difference in apparent latency produced by the test bed in various conditions. Similar methodology was employed with human participants to measure simulator sickness experienced by users of this test bed. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, apparent latency increased significantly as head movement frequency increased. Predictive compensation strategies significantly reduced apparent latency present in the test bed. In Experiment 2, predictive compensation significantly reduced the magnitude of simulator sickness. CONCLUSION: Predictive compensation can be effectively implemented to reduce apparent latency, resulting in a lower magnitude of simulator sickness. APPLICATION: Potential applications include HMD use in which head position is tracked and visual imagery is linked to head or body movement, such as in virtual and augmented reality systems, and is thus critical to functionality and performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The effect of viewpoint on the navigation of complex terrain and on spatial awareness was examined with the use of a simulated remotely operated vehicle. BACKGROUND: The ability to build terrain models in real time may soon allow remote vehicular control from any viewpoint. A virtual tether couples the viewpoint to the vehicle's position and orientation, but shows more of the terrain than a fully immersive egocentric display. In this sense, it provides visual momentum by providing a view that incorporates egocentric and exocentric qualities. METHOD: For this study, 12 participants navigated a simulated vehicle across complex virtual terrain using five different display viewpoints: egocentric, dynamic tether, rigid tether, 3-D exocentric, and 2-D exocentric. While navigating, participants had to avoid being seen by simulated enemy units. After the navigation task, participants' spatial awareness was assessed using a recognition task. RESULTS: The tethered displays minimized the time during which the participant's vehicle was visible to enemy positions. The egocentric display was more effective than exocentric displays (2-D or 3-D) for navigation, and the exocentric displays were more effective than egocentric for time seen during navigation and the recognition task. The tethered displays produced intermediate results for navigation and recognition. CONCLUSION: Viewpoint tethering produced the most effective displays for minimizing time seen, but tethered displays were less effective than egocentric and exocentric displays for navigation and recognition, respectively.

{"abstract":"Recent studies of youth aggression have emphasized the role of network-based peer influence processes. Other scholars have suggested that aggression is often motivated by status concerns. We integrate these two veins of research by considering the effects of peer status motivations on subsequent adolescent aggression, net of their own status motivations, prior aggression, and peer behavior. We also explore different levels at which peer effects may occur, considering the effects of reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships as well as larger, meso-level peer groups. We anticipate that peer group effects are magnified by both size and boundedness as measured by Freeman's (1972) Segregation Index. We find that, net of the adolescent's aggression at time 1, both the aggressive behaviors and the status valuations of friends independently increase the likelihood of aggression at time 2, six months later. The aggressive behavior of friends who do not reciprocate the adolescent's friendship nomination has particular impact. The average status valuation of peer groups increases their members' likelihood of aggression, even after controlling for their own attitudes about status, their friends' attitudes, and their friends' aggressive behavior. This effect is magnified in large groups and groups with high Freeman segregation scores. Language: en","authors":["Robert Faris","Susan T.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study contributes to human reliability analysis (HRA) by proposing a method that focuses more on human error causality within a sociotechnical system, illustrating its rationality and feasibility by using a case of the Minuteman (MM) III missile accident. BACKGROUND: Due to the complexity and dynamics within a sociotechnical system, previous analyses of accidents involving human and organizational factors clearly demonstrated that the methods using a sequential accident model are inadequate to analyze human error within a sociotechnical system. METHODS: System-theoretic accident model and processes (STAMP) was used to develop a universal framework of human error causal analysis. To elaborate the causal relationships and demonstrate the dynamics of human error, system dynamics (SD) modeling was conducted based on the framework. RESULTS: A total of 41 contributing factors, categorized into four types of human error, were identified through the STAMP-based analysis. All factors are related to a broad view of sociotechnical systems, and more comprehensive than the causation presented in the accident investigation report issued officially. Recommendations regarding both technical and managerial improvement for a lower risk of the accident are proposed. CONCLUSION: The interests of an interdisciplinary approach provide complementary support between system safety and human factors. The integrated method based on STAMP and SD model contributes to HRA effectively. APPLICATION: The proposed method will be beneficial to HRA, risk assessment, and control of the MM III operating process, as well as other sociotechnical systems.

{"abstract":"This paper studies the space-time properties of locations that are critical to travel activities in an urban environment. Specifically, we analyze locations on the urban street network from the perspective of the distribution of people's travel trajectories. We identify the intersections of an urban transportation network which are characterized by good connectivity, serving a high density of trip trajectories, and exhibiting multiple traversing patterns of trip trajectories as potential functionally critical network locations (FCNLs). A geospatial method is proposed to extract FCNLs from people's moving trajectories based on the street network. Two groups of quantitative indices are introduced to measure the evolution of the spatial extent and temporal variation patterns of different criticality levels of FCNLs. A case study using taxi trajectory data from Wuhan, China has been implemented. The results show that the FCNLs are very powerful in uncovering the space-time traveling patterns of a particular population and studying the relationship between urban functional structures and people's activities.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined operators' capacity to successfully reallocate highly autonomous in-flight missiles to time-sensitive targets while performing secondary tasks of varying complexity. BACKGROUND: Regardless of the level of autonomy for unmanned systems, humans will be necessarily involved in the mission planning, higher level operation, and contingency interventions, otherwise known as human supervisory control. As a result, more research is needed that addresses the impact of dynamic decision support systems that support rapid planning and replanning in time-pressured scenarios, particularly on operator workload. METHOD: A dual screen simulation that allows a single operator the ability to monitor and control 8, 12, or 16 missiles through high level replanning was tested on 42 U.S. Navy personnel. RESULTS: The most significant finding was that when attempting to control 16 missiles, participants' performance on three separate objective performance metrics and their situation awareness were significantly degraded. CONCLUSION: These results mirror studies of air traffic control that demonstrate a similar decline in performance for controllers managing 17 aircraft as compared with those managing only 10 to 11 aircraft. Moreover, the results suggest that a 70% utilization (percentage busy time) score is a valid threshold for predicting significant performance decay and could be a generalizable metric that can aid in manning predictions. APPLICATION: This research is relevant to human supervisory control of networked military and commercial unmanned vehicles in the air, on the ground, and on and under the water.

{"abstract":"This simulator-based study examined conventional auditory warnings (tonal, nonverbal sounds) and auditory icons (representational, nonverbal sounds), alone and in combination with a dash-mounted visual display, to present information about impending collision situations to commercial motor vehicle operators. Brake response times were measured for impending front-to-rear collision scenarios under 6 display configurations, 2 vehicle speeds, and 2 levels of headway. Accident occurrence was measured for impending side collision scenarios under 2 vehicle speeds, 2 levels of visual workload, 2 auditory displays, absence\/presence of mirrors, and absence\/presence of a dash-mounted iconic visual display. For both front-to-rear and side collision scenarios, auditory icons elicited significantly improved driver performance over conventional auditory warnings. Driver performance improved when collision warning information was presented through multiple modalities. Brake response times were significantly faster for impending front-to-rear collision scenarios using the longer headway condition. The presence of mirrors significantly reduced the number of accidents for impending side collision scenarios. Subjective preference data indicated that participants preferred multimodal displays over single-modality displays. Actual or potential applications for this research include auditory displays and warnings, information presentation, and the development of alternative user interfaces.

{"abstract":"Error processing and conflict monitoring are essential executive functions for goal directed actions and adaptation to conflicting information. Although medial frontal regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in these functions, there is still considerable heterogeneity regarding their spatio-temporal activations. The timing of these functions has been associated with two separable event-related potentials (ERPs) usually localized to the medial frontal wall, one during error processing (ERN - error related negativity) and one during conflict monitoring (N2). In this study we aimed to spatially and temporally dissociate conflict and error processing using simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data from a modified Flanker task in healthy adults. We demonstrate a spatial dissociation of conflict monitoring and error processing along the medial frontal wall, with selective conflict level dependent activation of the SMA\/pre-SMA. Activation to error processing was located in the ACC, rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and pre-SMA. The EEG-informed fMRI analysis revealed that stronger ERN amplitudes are associated with increased activation in a large coherent cluster comprising the ACC, RCZ and pre-SMA, while N2 amplitudes increased with activation in the pre-SMA. Conjunction analysis of EEG-informed fMRI revealed common activation of ERN and N2 in the pre-SMA and divergent activation in the RCZ. No conjoint activation between error processing and conflict monitoring was found with standard fMRI analysis along the medial frontal wall. Our fMRI findings clearly demonstrate that conflict monitoring and error processing are spatially dissociable along the medial frontal wall. Moreover, the overlap of ERN- and N2-informed fMRI activation in the pre-SMA provides new evidence that these ERP components share conflict related processing functions and are thus not completely separable.

{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of Internet addiction in a nationally representative sample of college students and to identify any associated psychosocial risk factors. The present study was constructed using a cross-sectional design with 3,616 participants. Participants were surveyed during the middle of the spring and fall semesters and recruited from colleges around Taiwan using stratified and cluster random sampling methods. Associations between Internet addiction and psychosocial risk factors were examined using stepwise logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of Internet addiction was found to be 15.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 14.1 percent to 16.5 percent). More depressive symptoms, higher positive outcome expectancy of Internet use, higher Internet usage time, lower refusal self-efficacy of Internet use, higher impulsivity, lower satisfaction with academic performance, being male, and insecure attachment style were positively correlated with Internet addiction. The prevalence of Internet addiction among college students in Taiwan was high, and the variables mentioned were independently predictive in the logistic regression analysis. This study can be used as a reference for policy making regarding the design of Internet addiction prevention programs and can also aid in the development of strategies designed to help Internet-addicted college students.

For both cybervictimization and cyberbullying, results support a gender invariant model involving 14 items and four factors covering four types of behaviors (written-verbal, visual, impersonation, and exclusion). The second-order confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that a \"global,\" second-order measure of cyberbullying and cybervictimization fits the data well. Overall, the scales showed good validity (construct, concurrent, and convergent) and reliability (internal consistency and test-retest).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study used a neuroergonomic approach to examine the interaction of mental and physical fatigue by assessing prefrontal cortex activation during submaximal fatiguing handgrip exercises. BACKGROUND: Mental fatigue is known to influence muscle function and motor performance, but its contribution to the development of voluntary physical fatigue is not well understood. METHOD: A total of 12 participants performed separate physical (control) and physical and mental fatigue (concurrent) conditions at 30% of their maximal handgrip strength until exhaustion. Functional near infrared spectroscopy was employed to measure prefrontal cortex activation, whereas electromyography and joint steadiness were used simultaneously to quantify muscular effort. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, blood oxygenation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex was significantly lower during submaximal fatiguing contractions associated with mental fatigue at exhaustion, despite comparable muscular responses. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that interference in the prefrontal cortex may influence motor output during tasks that require both physical and cognitive processing.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the visual discrimination speed and accuracy while using an LCD and a CRT display. BACKGROUND: LCDs have ergonomic advantages, but their main disadvantage is that they provide inconsistent photometric measures depending on the viewing angle (anisotropy). METHOD: Independent variables were screen type (LCD and CRT), viewing angle (0 degrees, 11 degrees, 41 degrees, 50 degrees, and 56 degrees) and user's age (teenagers, young adults, and middle-aged adults). Dependent variables were speed and accuracy in a visual discrimination task and user's ratings. RESULTS: The results corroborated the negative impact of LCD anisotropy. Visual discrimination times were by 7.6% slower when an LCD was used instead of a CRT. Performance differences increased with increasing viewing angle for both screens, but performance decrements were larger for the LCD. Young adults showed the best visual performance, as compared with teenagers and middle-aged adults. Effects of anisotropy were found for all age groups, although the performance of middle-aged adults was affected more when extended viewing angles were adopted. CONCLUSION: LCD anisotropy is a limiting factor for visual performance, especially in work settings where fast and accurate reactions are necessary.

BACKGROUND: We are primarily interested in transfer of skill from one phase to the next. More specifically, this study investigates whether the presence of stressors makes participants adhere to the sustained use of complex rules. METHOD: Participants learned to apply a complex rule in the first phase of a category learning task. In the second phase, this rule became dysfunctional and participants had to search for a new categorization rule in order to assign the stimuli to the correct classes. Two experiments were set up to investigate this issue. RESULTS: Participants were found to have difficulty discovering a complex Phase 2 rule in the presence of stressors, whereas the discovery of a simple rule was not hindered by the presence of stressors. CONCLUSION: In the discussion, it is argued that the present results are compatible with previous research on stressors showing that time pressure and noise induce the application of simple strategies.

{"abstract":"Pathological Internet use (PIU) occurs when excessive Internet use results in addictive symptoms that exert detrimental consequences on one's overall functioning and well-being. Poor family functioning has been found to be associated with youths' addictive Internet use, and parental use of active and restrictive mediation has been found to reduce online risk. The current study aims to test if parental active and restrictive mediation strategies are negatively associated with youths' PIU. Additionally, it also tests the effectiveness of these strategies as a function of the broader family environment with measures of parent-child attachment, family communication, and the youth's comfort with living at home. The data of 3,079 students in Singapore were analyzed through a series of logistic regressions. The results revealed that the family environment for students with PIU was significantly less positive. Only restrictive mediation was found to be negatively associated with PIU. This relation was stronger for higher levels of attachment, communication, and comfort at home, implying that the effectiveness of restrictive mediation varies with the degree of warmth and support in the general family environment.

BACKGROUND: ARTT has been shown to improve transfer to the criterion task in some military simulation experiments. We tested training speed and screen resolution in a project, sponsored by Defence Research and Development Canada, to develop components for prototype air mission simulators. METHOD: For this study, 54 participants used a single-screen PC-based flight simulation program to learn to chase and catch an F-18A fighter jet with another F-18A while controlling the chase aircraft with a throttle and side-stick controller. Screen resolution was varied between participants, and training speed was varied factorially across two sessions within participants. Pretest and posttest trials were at high resolution and criterion (900 knots) speed. RESULTS: Posttest performance was best with high screen resolution training and when one ARTT training session was followed by a session of criterion speed training. CONCLUSION: ARTT followed by criterion training improves performance on a visual-motor coordination task. We think that ARTT influences known facilitators of transfer, including similarity to the criterion task and contextual interference.

{"abstract":"Injury from blunt head impacts causes acute neurological deficits and may lead to chronic neurodegeneration. A head impact detection device can serve both as a research tool for studying head injury mechanisms and a clinical tool for real-time trauma screening. The simplest approach is an acceleration thresholding algorithm, which may falsely detect high-acceleration spurious events such as manual manipulation of the device. We designed a head impact detection system that distinguishes head impacts from non-impacts through two subsystems. First, we use infrared proximity sensing to determine if the mouthguard is worn on the teeth to filter out all offteeth events. Second, on-teeth, non-impact events are rejected using a support vector machine classifier trained on frequency domain features of linear acceleration and rotational velocity. The remaining events are classified as head impacts. In a controlled laboratory evaluation, the present system performed substantially better than a 10g acceleration threshold in head impact detection (98% sensitivity, 99.99% specificity, 99% accuracy, and 99.98% precision, compared to 92% sensitivity, 58% specificity, 65% accuracy, and 37% precision).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the development of a rigorous computational model of driver behavior in a cognitive architecture--a computational framework with underlying psychological theories that incorporate basic properties and limitations of the human system. BACKGROUND: Computational modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the complex task of driving, allowing researchers to simulate driver behavior and explore the parameters and constraints of this behavior. METHOD: An integrated driver model developed in the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture is described that focuses on the component processes of control, monitoring, and decision making in a multilane highway environment. RESULTS: This model accounts for the steering profiles, lateral position profiles, and gaze distributions of human drivers during lane keeping, curve negotiation, and lane changing. CONCLUSION: The model demonstrates how cognitive architectures facilitate understanding of driver behavior in the context of general human abilities and constraints and how the driving domain benefits cognitive architectures by pushing model development toward more complex, realistic tasks. APPLICATION: The model can also serve as a core computational engine for practical applications that predict and recognize driver behavior and distraction.

{"abstract":"The working environment of railways is challenging and complex and often involves high-risk operations which affect both the company staff and inhabitants of the towns and cities alongside the railway lines. Rail companies adopt several strategies to reduce the exposure to risk of their employees and the public, which involve having trained personnel, safety technologies and work practices. However, despite this, railways remain high-risk operations and unfortunate incidents still occur. In this paper a visual analytics system is employed to help in the management of railway safety. This system is based on a data analytics workflow to compile an incident risk index which processes information that has been collated with regard to incidents along the railway tracks. The results of this data analytics workflow (i.e. incident risk index) are then displayed in a visual form in a geographical map together with socioeconomic information about the towns and cities concerned. Feedback on this visual analytics system suggests that it can be used by safety engineers and specialists when making decisions and communicating these decisions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator study was conducted in order to assess the relative utility of unimodal auditory, unimodal vibrotactile, and combined audiotactile (i.e., multisensory) in-car warning signals to alert and inform drivers of likely front-to-rear-end collision events in a situation modeled on real-world driving. BACKGROUND: The implementation of nonvisual in-car warning signals may have important safety implications in lessening any visual overload during driving. Multisensory integration can provide synergistic facilitation effects. METHOD: The participants drove along a rural road in a car-following scenario in either the presence or absence of a radio program in the background. The brake light signals of the lead vehicle were also unpredictably either enabled or disabled on a trial-by-trial basis. RESULTS: The results showed that the participants initiated their braking responses significantly more rapidly following the presentation of audiotactile warning signals than following the presentation of either unimodal auditory or unimodal vibrotactile warning signals. CONCLUSION: Multisensory warning signals offer a particularly effective means of capturing driver attention in demanding situations such as driving. APPLICATION: The potential value of such multisensory in-car warning signals is explained with reference to recent cognitive neuroscience research.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of intermittent task parameters on muscle fatigue and endurance time during static shoulder abductions, with a long-term goal of establishing relationships between intermittent task parameters and short-term performance. BACKGROUND: Effects of intermittent work on endurance and fatigue development have been reported, and certain combinations of contraction levels and duty cycles have been proposed as design guidelines. These findings, however, were not derived from systematic manipulations of the task parameters. METHOD: Prolonged (1-hr maximum) intermittent shoulder abductions were performed at different combinations of contraction level (12% or 28% of muscle strength), duty cycle (.25 or .75), and cycle time (34 or 166 s). Fatigue was measured based on reductions in muscle strength and indirectly by changes in ratings of discomfort, electromyographic (EMG) amplitude, and EMG spectral distribution. RESULTS: Contraction level and duty cycle significantly affected endurance time and muscle fatigue, and interactive effects between these parameters were observed for some of the measures. Significant effects of cycle time were found only for EMG spectral measures. CONCLUSION: Endurance time and local fatigue were dependent on the comprehensive effects of the different task parameters. APPLICATION: Design changes to reduce the occurrence of localized fatigue during intermittent work need to take into account all the task parameters simultaneously.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Handgrip is a ubiquitous human movement that was critical in our evolution. However, the differences in brain activity between grip type (i.e. power or precision) and pattern (i.e. dynamic or static) are not fully understood. In order to address this, we performed Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis between grip type and grip pattern using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. ALE provides a probabilistic summary of the BOLD response in hundreds of subjects, which is often beyond the scope of a single fMRI experiment. METHODS: We collected data from 28 functional magnetic resonance data sets, which included a total of 398 male and female subjects. Using ALE, we analyzed the BOLD response during power, precision, static and dynamic grip in a range of forces and age in right handed healthy individuals without physical impairment, cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction using a variety of grip tools, feedback and experimental training. RESULTS: Power grip generates unique activation in the postcentral gyrus (area 1 and 3b) and precision grip generates unique activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA, area 6) and precentral gyrus (area 4a). Dynamic handgrip generates unique activation in the precentral gyrus (area 4p) and SMA (area 6) and of particular interest, both dynamic and static grip share activation in the area 2 of the postcentral gyrus, an area implicated in the evolution of handgrip. According to effect size analysis, precision and dynamic grip generates stronger activity than power and static, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates specific differences between grip type and pattern. However, there was a large degree of overlap in the pre and postcentral gyrus, SMA and areas of the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network, which indicates that other mechanisms are potentially involved in regulating handgrip. Further, our study provides empirically based regions of interest, which can be downloaded here within, that can be used to more effectively study power grip in a range of populations and conditions.

{"abstract":"Gang members carry guns and twitter accounts. Media outlets nationally have reported on a new phenomenon of gang affiliates using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to trade insults or make violence threats that lead homicide or victimization. We term this interaction internet banging. Police departments in metropolitan areas have increased resources in their gang violence units to combat this issue. Interestingly, there is little to no literature on this issue. We argue internet banging is a cultural phenomenon that has evolved from increased participation with social media and represents an adaptive structuration, or new and unintended use of existing online social media. We examine internet banging within the context of gang violence, paying close attention to the mechanisms and processes that may explain how and why internet banging has evolved. We examine the role of hip-hop in the development of internet banging and highlight the changing roles of both hip hop and computer mediated communication as social representations of life in violent communities. We explore the presentation of urban masculinity and its influence on social media behavior. Lastly, we conduct a textual analysis of music and video content that demonstrates violent responses to virtual interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated skill development and workload of pilots driving teleoperated unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through different apertures and viewpoints using the cornering law. BACKGROUND: Due to technological and cost restraints, humans are still needed for tasks involving UGVs. Operators of teleoperated UGVs are likely to have less situation awareness and thus are more prone to getting stuck or damaged when negotiating apertures.To our knowledge, the operation of physical UGVs through corners has not been examined. Therefore, a better understanding of cornering a teleoperated UGVs is imperative. METHOD: In Experiment 1, 20 novice participants repeatedly teleoperated a physical UGV using a third-person overhead view through apertures that varied in width. In Experiment 2, 18 additional novice participants completed a similar task but used a first-person view. RESULTS: Participants' performance increased (i.e., faster cornering times and less collisions) over sessions. The cornering law successfully modeled the effect of different aperture widths on participant performance for both viewing perspectives. CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully modeled human performance of teleoperated UGVs using the cornering law. Analogous to Fitts' and steering law, we were able to successfully model and predict cornering performance based on a derived index of cornering difficulty. APPLICATION: The cornering law could be used to aid in the development of prototype user interfaces and also to examine the effects of different teleoperation views (first person vs. third person).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research evaluated the effects of an advance warning device (AWD) on the safety of driver interactions with emergency vehicles (EVs). The AWD was intended to provide drivers with advance warning of an approaching on-call EV via visual and auditory warnings when the EV was within a 300- to 400-m radius. BACKGROUND: Research suggests that drivers can experience difficulty accurately detecting the distance and direction of approaching on-call EV. In-vehicle technology has not previously been explored as a means of overcoming the limitations of existing EV lights and sirens and improving driver detection of EV. METHOD: An experimental study using an advanced driving simulator examined the effects of the AWD on driving performance in a range of circumstances in which real-world EV crashes and near-misses commonly occur. Each event contained a combination of scenario type (adjacent lane, turning across, car following) and warning condition (control, standard, advance). RESULTS: Data from 22 participants were collected, including measures of speed, braking, and visual scanning. For adjacent-lane and turning-across events, the AWD was associated primarily with reductions in mean speed. The AWD resulted in an earlier lane change to clear a path for the EV in the car-following event. CONCLUSION: The reduction in speed observed was a positive finding, given the relationship between impact speed and injury severity. Response priming emerged as the mechanism underpinning these effects. Application: Response priming may result in safety benefits in other settings when an advisory warning is presented before the threat can be perceived. Language: en","authors":["Michael G.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the studies was to examine the role of implicit processes in aeronautical risk perception and risk taking. BACKGROUND: Aeronautical decision making consists of both explicit processes (e.g., comparing options, seeking information) and implicit, or intuitive, processes (e.g., immediate affective reactions). The present studies utilized a novel methodology, adapted from studies in social cognition, to examine the relationship between general aviation pilots' implicit reactions toward risk and their involvement in hazardous events. METHOD: The Implicit Association Test was used to measure pilots' (Study 1: N= 23; Study 2: N= 32) implicit associations between good and bad weather conditions and perceptions of risk and anxiety. RESULTS: There was a relationship between the pilots' implicit perceptions and previous involvement in hazardous aeronautical events as measured by D. R. Hunter's (1995, 2002) Hazardous Events Scale. The more weather-related hazardous events the pilots had been involved in, the less they associated implicit risk with adverse weather (Study 1) and the less implicitly anxious they were toward adverse weather (Study 2). CONCLUSION: The results show a relationship between implicit associations and risk-taking behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of operational variables on diagnosis and decision-making processes, focusing on information search. BACKGROUND: Arguably, the\"best\"decision-making processes in high-technology cockpits would be those that are both correspondent (objectively accurate) and coherent (rationally sound). In the electronic world, coherence in terms of identification and incorporation of all relevant information is both a prerequisite to and a limiting factor for accurate diagnosis and decision making. METHOD: Regional carrier pilots (N=93) responded to six scenarios by accessing information to determine a diagnosis and decision. RESULTS: Time pressure, a common operational variable, had a strong negative effect on information search and diagnosis accuracy, and the presence of noncongruent information heightened these negative effects. Unexpectedly, source of initial information (automated or other) did not impact any of the dependent variables. Diagnosis confidence was unrelated to accuracy and was negatively related to amount of information accessed. CONCLUSION: Results confirm both the need for coherence in diagnostic processes and the difficulty of maintaining it under time pressure. APPLICATION: One implication of the results of this study is that pilots in high-technology cockpits must be trained to utilize coherent diagnostic processes as standard operating procedure. Additionally, because thorough information search for diagnosis in an automated environment is essential, automated systems must be designed to foster coherent, and thus accurate, diagnostic processes.

{"abstract":"Existing approaches that explain the behavior of workers in noisy environments rarely include quantitative variables related to central factors such as noise exposure levels and workers' hearing status. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship among individual, contextual, and perceptual-cognitive factors and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). We studied 516 industrial workers exposed to noise levels greater than the Portuguese action level and developed a conceptual model for HPD use. The multivariate data analysis of the several variables considered revealed that individual risk perception and the outcome value for hearing preservation were the main direct predictors of the use of HPDs. Workers' opinions about the company's safety climate and their perception of noise exposure effects also play important roles as predictors. However, much of the effects of these factors are indirect (i.e., mediated by other variables). Furthermore, these results suggest that risk perception should be considered an essential issue in the design and implementation of any hearing conservation program, particularly in the development of training programs. Actual or potential applications of this research include the definition of more accurate strategies for promoting and motivating the use of HPDs. Language: en","authors":["P. Arezes","A.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Haptic shared control was investigated as a human-machine interface that can intuitively share control between drivers and an automatic controller for curve negotiation. BACKGROUND: As long as automation systems are not fully reliable, a role remains for the driver to be vigilant to the system and the environment to catch any automation errors. The conventional binary switches between supervisory and manual control has many known issues, and haptic shared control is a promising alternative. METHOD: A total of 42 respondents of varying age and driving experience participated in a driving experiment in a fixed-base simulator, in which curve negotiation behavior during shared control was compared to during manual control, as well as to three haptic tunings of an automatic controller without driver intervention. RESULTS: Under the experimental conditions studied, the main beneficial effect of haptic shared control compared to manual control was that less control activity (16% in steering wheel reversal rate, 15% in standard deviation of steering wheel angle) was needed for realizing an improved safety performance (e.g., 11% in peak lateral error). Full automation removed the need for any human control activity and improved safety performance (e.g., 35% in peak lateral error) but put the human in a supervisory position. CONCLUSION: Haptic shared control kept the driver in the loop, with enhanced performance at reduced control activity, mitigating the known issues that plague full automation. APPLICATION: Haptic support for vehicular control ultimately seeks to intuitively combine human intelligence and creativity with the benefits of automation systems.

{"abstract":"Prior research on the psychology of retribution is complicated by the difficulty of separating retributive and general deterrence motives when studying human offenders (Study 1). We isolate retribution by investigating judgments about punishing animals, which allows us to remove general deterrence from consideration. Studies 2 and 3 document a \"victim identity\" effect, such that the greater the perceived loss from a violent animal attack, the greater the belief that the culprit deserves to be killed. Study 3 documents a \"targeted punishment\" effect, such that the responsive killing of the actual \"guilty\" culprit is seen as more deserved than the killing of an almost identical yet \"innocent\" animal from the same species. Studies 4 and 5 extend both effects to participants' acceptance of inflicting pain and suffering on the offending animal at the time of its death, and show that both effects are mediated by measures of retributive sentiment, and not by consequentialist concerns.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Pre-synaptic D2 receptors regulate striatal dopamine release and DAT activity, key factors for modulation of motor pathways. A functional SNP of DRD2 (rs1076560 G>T) is associated with alternative splicing such that the relative expression of D2S (mainly pre-synaptic) vs. D2L (mainly post-synaptic) receptor isoforms is decreased in subjects with the T allele with a putative increase of striatal dopamine levels. To evaluate how DRD2 genotype and striatal dopamine signaling predict motor cortical activity and behavior in humans, we have investigated the association of rs1076560 with BOLD fMRI activity during a motor task. To further evaluate the relationship of this circuitry with dopamine signaling, we also explored the correlation between genotype based differences in motor brain activity and pre-synaptic striatal DAT binding measured with [(123)I] FP-CIT SPECT. METHODS: Fifty healthy subjects, genotyped for DRD2 rs1076560 were studied with BOLD-fMRI at 3T while performing a visually paced motor task with their right hand; eleven of these subjects also underwent [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT. SPM5 random-effects models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele had greater BOLD responses in left basal ganglia, thalamus, supplementary motor area, and primary motor cortex, whose activity was also negatively correlated with reaction time at the task. Moreover, left striatal DAT binding and activity of left supplementary motor area were negatively correlated. INTERPRETATION: The present results suggest that DRD2 genetic variation was associated with focusing of responses in the whole motor network, in which activity of predictable nodes was correlated with reaction time and with striatal pre-synaptic dopamine signaling. Our results in humans may help shed light on genetic risk for neurobiological mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of disorders with dysregulation of striatal dopamine like Parkinson's Disease.

We present an experiment on a restless bandit task in which participants made repeated choices between options for which the average rewards changed over time. Comparing a number of computational models of participants' behavior in this task, we find evidence that a substantial number of them balanced exploration and exploitation by considering the probability that an option offers the maximum reward out of all the available options.

{"abstract":"Twenty women were asked to generate forces using a dynamometer that were consistent with one of three different work-rest schedules (a low-, medium-, and high-force schedule). Each work-rest schedule consisted of 6 identical blocks of 10 work-rest cycles. Each of the 10 work-rest cycles lasted 1 min. The first work-rest cycle in each block consisted of a 6-s maximal voluntary contraction and a 54-s rest. The remaining 9 work-rest cycles in each block consisted of a submaximal contraction and a rest period. The desired force of the submaximal contraction, the length of this contraction, and the duration of the rest period remained constant within schedules but varied across schedules. The amount of physiological work was kept constant among schedules. The fatigue that developed in the medium-force schedule was significantly lower than that developed in either the low- or high-force schedule. A model was developed that predicted the amount of fatiguable strength at the beginning and end of each contraction of a work-rest cycle. When fit to the results from the experiment, the model explained 94% of the variance. The model can be used to predict the work-rest schedule that minimizes fatigue in a given repetitive job, thereby potentially increasing productivity and reducing the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this article, I present the ideas and trends that have given rise to the use of cognitive architectures in human factors and provide a cognitive engineering-oriented taxonomy of these architectures and a snapshot of their use for cognitive engineering. BACKGROUND: Architectures of cognition have had a long history in human factors but a brief past. The long history entails a 50-year preamble, whereas the explosion of work in the current decade reflects the brief past. Understanding this history is key to understanding the current and future prospects for applying cognitive science theory to human factors practice. METHOD: The review defines three formative eras in cognitive engineering research: the 1950s, 1980s, and now. RESULTS: In the first era, the fledging fields of cognitive science and human factors emphasized characteristics of the dancer the limited capacity or bounded rationality view of the mind, and the ballroom, the task environment. The second era emphasized the dance (i.e., the dynamic interaction between mental operations and task environment). The third era has seen the rise of cognitive architectures as tools for choreographing the dance of mental operations within the complex environments posed by human factors practice. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid architectures present the best vector for introducing cognitive science theories into a renewed engineering-based human factors. APPLICATION: The taxonomy provided in this article may provide guidance on when and whether to apply a cognitive science or a hybrid architecture to a human factors issue.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We present a snapshot of the work on situation awareness, which involves operators' comprehension of the dynamic situation that they are monitoring or controlling. BACKGROUND: Although human factors has always been concerned with helping the operator in his or her work environment, research exploded in the mid-1990s on one relevant construct, situation awareness. METHOD: We discuss how a distinction present years ago, the product of comprehension versus the process of comprehension, not only continues today but characterizes different research directions. Research on situation awareness has benefited and can continue to benefit from an analogy to the better understood comprehension of narrative and expository text, although such an analogy between text and dynamic environments will ultimately have limits. RESULTS: Situation awareness as a notion that organizes and focuses research efforts has rightfully spread to research in virtually every industrial domain, and it is an essential part of work on automation and design. CONCLUSION: Work on situation awareness has had a ubiquitous influence on cognitive engineering and has even pushed the envelope of basic cognitive psychology into dynamic domains. APPLICATION: Considering situation awareness is also important in cognitive ergonomic issues relevant to training, teamwork, and the design of new human-technical systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine if a wearable system based on a head-mounted display (HMD) causes users to alter their head position and adopt postures that place greater stress on the musculoskeletal system. BACKGROUND: HMDs are common output devices used with wearable computers. HMDs provide the wearer with visual information by projecting computer-generated virtual images in front of the eyes. Deviations of neck posture from a neutral upright position increase the stresses on the musculoskeletal system of the head and neck. METHOD: Seven paramedics simulated the treatment of a patient under a normal condition and when using an HMD wearable computer system. During the simulations a posture analysis was performed using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment method. RESULTS: The postures adopted when wearing an HMD, as compared with a normal condition, scored significantly higher for the neck (z = 2.463, p < .05) and for overall body posture (left side of the body: z = 2.447, p < .05; right side of the body: z = 2.895, p < .05). CONCLUSION: Wearing an HMD can force the wearers to modify their neck posture. As such, the musculoskeletal system of the head and neck may be placed under increased levels of stress. APPLICATION: Potential users should be made aware that HMDs could dictate modifications in neck posture, which may have detrimental effects and may compound the weight effect of the HMD.

{"abstract":"When people simultaneously draw lines with one hand and circles with the other hand, both trajectories tend to assume an oval shape, showing that hand motor programs interact (the so-called \"bimanual coupling effect\"). The aim of the present study was to investigate how motor parameters (drawing trajectories) and the related brain activity vary during bimanual movements both in real execution and in motor imagery tasks. In the 'Real' modality, subjects performed right hand movements (lines) and, simultaneously, Congruent (lines) or Non-congruent (circles) left hand movements. In the 'Imagery' modality, subjects performed only right hand movements (lines) and, simultaneously, imagined Congruent (lines) or Non-congruent (circles) left hand movements. Behavioral results showed similar interference of both the real and the imagined circles on the actually executed lines, suggesting that the coupling effect also pertains to motor imagery. Neuroimaging results showed that a prefrontal-parietal network, mostly involving the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), was significantly more active in Non-congruent than in Congruent conditions, irrespective of task (Real or Imagery). The data also confirmed specific roles of the right superior parietal lobe (SPL) in mediating spatial interference, and of the left PPC in motor imagery. Collectively, these findings suggest that real and imagined non-congruent movements activate common circuits related to the intentional and predictive operation generating bimanual coupling, in which the pre-SMA and the PPC play a crucial role.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study explored the potential for auditory and haptic spatial cuing approaches to alert drivers to the direction of a crash threat. BACKGROUND: For an automobile equipped with multiple crash avoidance systems, effective cuing of the crash threat direction may help the driver avoid the crash. Because the driver may not be looking in the direction of a visual crash alert, nonvisual crash alerts were explored as an additional means of directing attention to a potential crash situation. METHODS: In this in-traffic study, 32 drivers were asked to verbally report alert direction in the absence of any crash threats. Driver localization accuracy and response time were examined as a function of eight alert locations surrounding the vehicle and four directional alert approaches (auditory, haptic, haptic and auditory, and haptic and nondirectional auditory). The auditory directional alert approach used four speakers and broadband alert sounds, and the haptic directional alert approach used vibrations generated at various locations on the bottom of the driver's seat. RESULTS: Overall, relative to the auditory alert approach, the three approaches that included the haptic seat alert component reduced correct localization response times by 257 ms and increased percentage correct localization from 32% to 84%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that seat vibration alerts are a promising candidate for alerting drivers to the direction of a crash threat.

{"abstract":"The relative contribution of number of fixations and fixation duration to reaction time in visual search was investigated. Ten participants (age 20-24 years) took part in each of two experiments. In Experiment 1, the experimental factors were display type (icon and file name), organization (arrangements with and without grouping), and number of stimuli presented (4, 8, and 16). In Experiment 2, a search task for a target stimulus (three prespecified random letters) was conducted, and the experimental factor was the display's layout complexity. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine whether reaction time was explained by a mediational model in which reaction time is mediated by eye movements and display features are not directly related to reaction time. The mediational model was not supported, and the effects of display features on reaction time were not attributable solely to eye movements. The interaction between number of fixations and fixation duration was also explored as a function of display features. As the display feature changed and the task became more difficult, the contribution of the number of fixations to explain the variation in reaction time became dominant for both experiments. Potential applications include measurements of cognitive ability, eye muscle balance disorders, and binocular fusion ability.

{"abstract":"The modeling of eco-driving behaviors is a key issue in the research of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Most efforts have been made regarding internal combustion vehicles, and few works have been reported in the field of electric vehicles. On the other hand, these behavior analyses are usually conducted through naturalistic driving researches that involve the use of instrumented vehicles, available in a small number, which reduces the impact of the results. This paper presents a system for estimating the remaining charge of an electric vehicle by considering the driving behavior measured using a smartphone. For this purpose, first of all, data measured by the smartphone and by the onboard instrumentation were compared in order to demonstrate that both sources are equivalent and that the former is sufficiently accurate. The driving profiles obtained were then used to estimate the expected battery consumption of the electric vehicle using a Neural Network to represent the model that uses the information provided from the smartphone as input, such as speed, acceleration and jerk. The system has been tested with 10 drivers with a prediction capability of the expected battery consumption higher than 95%. These results show that a smartphone is a tool with a sufficient degree of fidelity to capture data from drivers, and so avoid expensive, complex systems like instrumented vehicles, and it can also be used for estimating energy consumption and predicting the remaining battery charge.

{"abstract":"The role of sensory information in motor control has been studied, but the cortical processing underlying cross-modal relationship between visual and somatosensory information for movement execution remains a matter of debate. Visual estimates of limb positions are congruent with proprioceptive estimates under normal visual conditions, but a mismatch between the watched and felt movement of the hand disrupts motor execution. We investigated whether activation in somatosensory areas was affected by the discordance between the intended and an executed action. Subjects performed self-paced thumb movement of the left hand under normal visual and mirror conditions. The Mirror condition provided a non-veridical and unexpected visual feedback. The results showed activity in the primary somatosensory area to be inhibited and activity in the secondary somatosensory area (SII) to be enhanced with voluntary movement, and neural responses in the SII and parietal cortex were strongly affected by the unexpected visual feedback. These results provide evidence that the visual information plays a crucial role in activation in somatosensory areas during motor execution. A mechanism that monitors sensory inputs and motor outputs congruent with current intension is necessary to control voluntary movement.

{"abstract":"Groups of activated neurons typically synchronize in the gamma-frequency band (30-100Hz), and gamma-band synchronization has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions. Those functions are ultimately expressed as behavior and therefore, functional gamma-band synchronization should be directly related to behavior. We recorded the magnetoencephalogram in human subjects and used a visual stimulus to induce occipital gamma-band activity. We found that the strength of this gamma-band activity at a given moment predicted the speed with which the subject was able to report a change in the stimulus. This predictive effect was restricted in time, frequency and space: It started only around 200ms before the behaviorally relevant stimulus change, was present only between 50 and 80Hz, and was significant only in bilateral middle occipital gyrus, while the peak of overall visually induced gamma-band activity was found in the calcarine sulcus.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Effects of four types of automation support and two levels of automation reliability were examined. The objective was to examine the differential impact of information and decision automation and to investigate the costs of automation unreliability. BACKGROUND: Research has shown that imperfect automation can lead to differential effects of stages and levels of automation on human performance. Method: Eighteen participants performed a\"sensor to shooter\"targeting simulation of command and control. Dependent variables included accuracy and response time of target engagement decisions, secondary task performance, and subjective ratings of mental work-load, trust, and self-confidence. RESULTS: Compared with manual performance, reliable automation significantly reduced decision times. Unreliable automation led to greater cost in decision-making accuracy under the higher automation reliability condition for three different forms of decision automation relative to information automation. At low automation reliability, however, there was a cost in performance for both information and decision automation. CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with a model of human-automation interaction that requires evaluation of the different stages of information processing to which automation support can be applied. APPLICATION: If fully reliable decision automation cannot be guaranteed, designers should provide users with information automation support or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of raw data.

{"abstract":"Emergency management is a diverse field. Effective disaster management involves knowledge of various subjects as well as work experience in all aspects related to mitigation, planning, response, and recovery efforts. One field not being fully exploited by disaster management is the use of geospatial tools in the form of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography, and geovisualization. One reason for this is that many emergency managers are not fully aware of the assistance GIS can lend to effectively manage disaster situations. All functions of emergency management have a strong geographic component. Where is the earthquake epicenter? Where is the damage? Where does the dam inundation run and who\/what is in that path? Where is the area of road closures? The questions asking \"where\" are endless in effective emergency management and range from the mitigation stage through to the recovery stage. For example, a tsunami may inundate only a certain portion of the region, therefore, it is important to have mitigation and planning efforts concentrated in those regions. It is also important to know what businesses, housing, and populations are in the affected areas. The integration of geospatial tools for risk assessment, mitigation, planning, response, and recovery efforts is emerging as an effective and potentially invaluable resource for answering such questions in regards to emergency management.

{"abstract":"Is there one optimal topology of functional brain networks at rest from which our cognitive performance would profit? Previous studies suggest that functional integration of resting state brain networks is an important biomarker for cognitive performance. However, it is still unknown whether higher network integration is an unspecific predictor for good cognitive performance or, alternatively, whether specific network organization during rest predicts only specific cognitive abilities. Here, we investigated the relationship between network integration at rest and cognitive performance using two tasks that measured different aspects of working memory; one task assessed visual-spatial and the other numerical working memory. Network clustering, modularity and efficiency were computed to capture network integration on different levels of network organisation, and to statistically compare their correlations with the performance in each working memory test. The results revealed that each working memory aspect profits from a different resting state topology, and the tests showed significantly different correlations with each of the measures of network integration. While higher global network integration and modularity predicted significantly better performance in visual-spatial working memory, both measures showed no significant correlation with numerical working memory performance. In contrast, numerical working memory was superior in subjects with highly clustered brain networks, predominantly in the intraparietal sulcus, a core brain region of the working memory network. Our findings suggest that a specific balance between local and global functional integration of resting state brain networks facilitates special aspects of cognitive performance. In the context of working memory, while visual-spatial performance is facilitated by globally integrated functional resting state brain networks, numerical working memory profits from increased capacities for local processing, especially in brain regions involved in working memory performance.

{"abstract":"The event-related potential (ERP) literature described two error-related brain activities: the error-related negativity (Ne\/ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), peaking immediately after the erroneous response. ERP studies on error processing adopted a response-locked approach, thus, the question about the activities preceding the error is still open. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the activities preceding the false alarms (FA) are different from those occurring in the correct (responded or inhibited) trials. To this aim, we studied a sample of 36 Go\/No-go performers, adopting a stimulus-locked segmentation also including the pre-motor brain activities. Present results showed that neither pre-stimulus nor perceptual activities explain why we commit FA. In contrast, we observed condition-related differences in two pre-response components: the fronto-central N2 and the prefrontal positivity (pP), respectively peaking at 250ms and 310ms after the stimulus onset. The N2 amplitude of FA was identical to that recorded in No-go trials, and larger than Hits. Because the new findings challenge the previous interpretations on the N2, a new perspective is discussed. On the other hand, the pP in the FA trials was larger than No-go and smaller than Go, suggesting an erroneous processing at the stimulus-response mapping level: because this stage triggers the response execution, we concluded that the neural processes underlying the pP were mainly responsible for the subsequent error commission. Finally, sLORETA source analyses of the post-error potentials extended previous findings indicating, for the first time in the ERP literature, the right anterior insula as Pe generator.

{"abstract":"Hostility online has not been evaluated by an empirical investigation. This study aims to evaluate (a) the difference between hostility in the real world and that online and (b) whether the difference is associated with Internet addiction, depression, or online activities. A total of 2,348 college students (1,124 males and 1,224 females) were recruited and completed the Chen Internet Addiction Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale, and the questionnaire for online activity. Further, the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory-Chinese version-short form was utilized to evaluate hostility in both real and virtual worlds. The results demonstrated that the levels of all four dimensions of hostility were lower when getting online than those in the real world. Subjects with Internet addiction had higher hostility both in the real world and online as do subjects with depression. Further, college students with Internet addiction had increased expressive hostility behavior and those with depression had decreased hostility cognition, hostility affection, and suppressive hostility behavior when getting online. Lastly, the buffering effect of the Internet on hostility was attenuated among subjects paying the most online time in chatting, and those using the Internet mainly for online gaming had higher expressive hostility behavior not only in the real world but also online. These results suggest that attention should be paid to interventions concerning aggressive behavior among subjects with Internet addiction or online gaming and chatting. On the other hand, depressed college students would be less hostile after entering the Internet. It is suggested that the Internet would be one possible interactive media to provide intervention for depression.

{"abstract":"Alex Green was a pioneering operations analyst\/researcher for the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. His February 1945 operations analysis \"Report on the Combat Performance of the Remote Control Turrets of B-29 Aircraft\" was classified and buried for 70 years. Stationed in the China-Burma-India theatre and addressing a problem of combat losses posed by General Curtis LeMay, Green used written reports and interviews to draw conclusions regarding direction of enemy attack on the B-29s, opposite those of a large stateside simulation study. Resulting in LeMay's changes in B-29 flight formations and frontal armaments, his report also addressed B-29 gun dispersion adjustments and modifications to the analog computer in the plane's nose. This paper examines how Green drew his conclusions under wartime conditions before digital computers.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study developed and tested a model of car following by human drivers. BACKGROUND: Previous models of car following are based on 3-D parameters such as lead vehicle speed and distance information, which are not directly available to a driver. In the present paper we present the driving by visual angle (DVA) model, which is based on the visual information (visual angle and rate of change of visual angle) available to the driver. METHOD: Two experiments in a driving simulator examined car-following performance in response to speed variations of a lead vehicle defined by a sum of sine wave oscillations and ramp acceleration functions. In addition, the model was applied to six driving events using real world-driving data. RESULTS: The model provided a good fit to car-following performance in the driving simulation studies as well as in real-world driving performance. A comparison with the advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN) model, which is based on 3-D parameters, suggests that the DVA was more predictive of driver behavior in matching lead vehicle speed and distance headway. CONCLUSION: Car-following behavior can be modeled using only visual information to the driver and can produce performance more predictive of driver performance than models based on 3-D (speed or distance) information.

{"abstract":"While much is known about differences in decision making outcomes related to pilot expertise, less is known about the processes that underlie these differences. We explored expertise differences in decision making processes by simultaneously measuring expert and novice pilots' attention, using eye-tracking, and their decision outcomes in a realistic context. We also investigated how expertise differences in pilots' attentional strategies were influenced by cue properties of diagnosticity and correlation. Fourteen expert and 14 novice pilots flew brief simulated flights. Half the flights contained failures that required diagnosis and an action (i.e., a decision). The environmental cues that signaled these failures varied in diagnosticity and\/or correlation. We found that experts made better decisions than novices in terms of speed and accuracy. Both groups made faster correct decisions when cues were higher in diagnosticity. Only experts made faster correct decisions when cues were correlated. Experts attended more to cues relevant to the failure when a failure was present. Findings suggest that expertise differences in decision outcomes partly reflect attentional strategies relevant to problem diagnosis. Language: en","authors":["Angela Schriver","Daniel G.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors used algorithms to estimate driver distraction and predict crash and near-crash risk on the basis of driver glance behavior using the data set of the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study. BACKGROUND: Driver distraction has been a leading cause of motor vehicle crashes, but the relationship between distractions and crash risk lacks detailed quantification. METHOD: The authors compared 24 algorithms that varied according to how they incorporated three potential contributors to distraction--glance duration, glance history, and glance location--on how well the algorithms predicted crash risk. RESULTS: Distraction estimated from driver eye-glance patterns was positively associated with crash risk. The algorithms incorporating ongoing off-road glance duration predicted crash risk better than did the algorithms incorporating glance history. Augmenting glance duration with other elements of glance behavior--1.5th power of duration and duration weighted by glance location--produced similar prediction performance as glance duration alone.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments examined whether prior interaction within an immersive virtual environment (VE) enabled people to improve the accuracy of their distance judgments and whether an improved ability to estimate distance generalized to other means of estimating distances. BACKGROUND: Prior literature has consistently found that users of immersive VEs underestimate distances by approximately 50%. METHOD: In each of the two experiments, 16 participants viewed objects in an immersive VE and estimated their distance to them by means of blindfolded walking tasks before and after interacting with the VE. RESULTS: The interaction task significantly corrected users' underestimation bias to nearly veridical. Differences between pre- and post-interaction mean distance estimation accuracy were large (d = 4.63), and significant (p < .001), and they generalized across response task. CONCLUSION: This finding limits the generality of the underestimation effect in VEs and suggests that distance underestimation in VEs may not be a road block to the development of VE applications.

{"abstract":"This investigation had two main objectives: 1) to assess the comparability of volumes determined by operator-controlled image quantification with automated image analysis in evaluating atrophic brain changes related to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children, and 2) to assess the extent of diffuse structural changes throughout the brain as determined by reduced volume of a brain structure or region of interest (ROI). Operator-controlled methods used ANALYZE(R) software for segmentation and tracing routines of pre-defined brain structures and ROIs. For automated image analyses, the open-access FreeSurfer program was used. Sixteen children with moderate-to-severe TBI were compared to individually matched, typically developing control children and the volumes of 18 brain structures and\/or ROIs were compared between the two methods. Both methods detected atrophic changes but differed in the magnitude of the atrophic effect with the best agreement in subcortical structures. The volumes of all brain structures\/ROIs were smaller in the TBI group regardless of method used; overall effect size differences were minimal for caudate and putamen but moderate to large for all other measures. This is reflective of the diffuse nature of TBI and its widespread impact on structural brain integrity, indicating that both FreeSurfer and operator-controlled methods can reliably assess volumetric changes in pediatric TBI.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare a standardized road test to naturalistic driving by older people who may have cognitive impairment to define improvements that could potentially enhance the validity of road testing in this population. BACKGROUND: Road testing has been widely adapted as a tool to assess driving competence of older people who may be at risk for unsafe driving because of dementia; however, the validity of this approach has not been rigorously evaluated. METHOD: For 2 weeks, 80 older drivers (38 healthy elders and 42 with cognitive impairment) who passed a standardized road test were video recorded in their own vehicles. Using a standardized rating scale, 4 hr of video was rated by a driving instructor. The authors examine weighting of individual road test items to form global impressions and to compare road test and naturalistic driving using factor analyses of these two assessments. RESULTS: The road test score was unidimensional, reflecting a major factor related to awareness of signage and traffic behavior. Naturalistic driving reflected two factors related to lane keeping as well as traffic behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: General aviation (GA) pilot performance utilizing a mixed-modality simulated data link was objectively evaluated based on the time required in accessing, understanding, and executing data link commands. Additional subjective data were gathered on workload, situation awareness (SA), and preference. BACKGROUND: Research exploring mixed-modality data link integration to the single-pilot GA cockpit is lacking, especially with respect to potential effects on safety. METHODS: Sixteen visual flight rules (VFR)-rated pilots participated in an experiment using a flight simulator equipped with a mixed-modality data link. Data link modalities were text display, synthesized speech, digitized speech, and synthesized speech\/text combination. Flight conditions included VFR (unlimited ceiling and visibility) or marginal VFR flight conditions (clouds 2,800 ft above ground level, 3-mile visibility). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in pilot performance, mental workload, and SA across the data link modalities. Textual data link resulted in increased time and workload as compared with the three speech-type data link conditions, which did not differ. SA measures indicated higher performance with textual and digitized speech data link conditions. CONCLUSION: Textual data link can be significantly enhanced for single-pilot GA operations by the addition of a speech component.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: These experiments address concerns that motor vehicles in electric engine mode are so quiet that they pose a risk to pedestrians, especially those with visual impairments. BACKGROUND: The \"quiet car\" issue has focused on hybrid and electric vehicles, although it also applies to internal combustion engine vehicles. Previous research has focused on detectability of vehicles, mostly in quiet settings. Instead, we focused on the functional ability to perceive vehicle motion paths. METHOD: Participants judged whether simulated vehicles were traveling straight or turning, with emphasis on the impact of background traffic sound. RESULTS: In quiet, listeners made the straight-or-turn judgment soon enough in the vehicle's path to be useful for deciding whether to start crossing the street. This judgment is based largely on sound level cues rather than the spatial direction of the vehicle. With even moderate background traffic sound, the ability to tell straight from turn paths is severely compromised. The signal-to-noise ratio needed for the straight-or-turn judgment is much higher than that needed to detect a vehicle. CONCLUSION: Although a requirement for a minimum vehicle sound level might enhance detection of vehicles in quiet settings, it is unlikely that this requirement would contribute to pedestrian awareness of vehicle movements in typical traffic settings with many vehicles present. APPLICATION: The findings are relevant to deliberations by government agencies and automobile manufacturers about standards for minimum automobile sounds and, more generally, for solutions to pedestrians' needs for information about traffic, especially for pedestrians with sensory impairments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to better understand the role played by perceptual load, at both central and peripheral regions of the visual scene, in driving safety. BACKGROUND: Attention is a crucial factor in driving safety, and previous laboratory studies suggest that perceptual load is an important factor determining the efficiency of attentional selectivity. Yet, the effects of perceptual load on driving were never studied systematically. METHOD: Using a driving simulator, we orthogonally manipulated the load levels at the road (central load) and its sides (peripheral load), while occasionally introducing critical events at one of these regions. RESULTS: Perceptual load affected driving performance at both regions of the visual scene. Critically, the effect was different for central versus peripheral load: Whereas load levels on the road mainly affected driving speed, load levels on its sides mainly affected the ability to detect critical events initiating from the roadsides. Moreover, higher levels of peripheral load impaired performance but mainly with low levels of central load, replicating findings with simple letter stimuli. CONCLUSION: Perceptual load has a considerable effect on driving, but the nature of this effect depends on the region of the visual scene at which the load is introduced. APPLICATION: Given the observed importance of perceptual load, authors of future studies of driving safety should take it into account. Specifically, these findings suggest that our understanding of factors that may be relevant for driving safety would benefit from studying these factors under different levels of load at different regions of the visual scene.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a robust, real-time system for detecting driver lane changes. Background: As intelligent transportation systems evolve to assist drivers in their intended behaviors, the systems have demonstrated a need for methods of inferring driver intentions and detecting intended maneuvers. METHOD: Using a \"model tracing\" methodology, our system simulates a set of possible driver intentions and their resulting behaviors using a simplification of a previously validated computational model of driver behavior. The system compares the model's simulated behavior with a driver's actual observed behavior and thus continually infers the driver's unobservable intentions from her or his observable actions. RESULTS: For data collected in a driving simulator, the system detects 82% of lane changes within 0.5 s of maneuver onset (assuming a 5% false alarm rate), 93% within 1 s, and 95% before the vehicle moves one fourth of the lane width laterally. For data collected from an instrumented vehicle, the system detects 61% within 0.5 s, 77% within 1 s, and 84% before the vehicle moves one-fourth of the lane width laterally. CONCLUSION: The model-tracing system is the first system to demonstrate high sample-by-sample accuracy at low false alarm rates as well as high accuracy over the course of a lane change with respect to time and lateral movement. APPLICATION: By providing robust real-time detection of driver lane changes, the system shows good promise for incorporation into the next generation of intelligent transportation systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examines how naturalistic driving performance is influenced by the perceived reliability of an in-vehicle warning system using a unique measure of perceived reliability. BACKGROUND: Prior studies of warning reliability conducted in simulator and test-track experiments demonstrate that the objective reliability of a warning can influence a driver's responsiveness to that warning. METHODS: Driver responses to lateral drift warnings (LDWs) were examined to determine if the latency to initiate a corrective steering response was related to the subjective reliability of prior system performance. An operational definition of subjective reliability was developed based on measures of the proportion of LDWs responded to by a steering correction in the preceding 24-hr period - the day proportion. Age, gender, weather condition, light level, road class, weekday status, and day proportion were used to model correction latency in a linear model. RESULTS: A main effect of day proportion was found, suggesting that reaction time to respond decreases by about 375 ms as the day proportion increases from 0 to 1. CONCLUSION: The study illustrates a method of quantifying subjective reliability and performance using naturalistic data. The results suggest that latency to make a steering correction is inversely related to the perceived reliability of the warning system in the 24 hr preceding the warning. APPLICATION: The results have direct application to the method of assessing the efficacy of in-vehicle collision warning systems, suggesting that use of a perceived reliability measure may better predict a driver's disposition to respond to a warning.

{"abstract":"Recent studies showed that active yaw moment control is the most effective method to improve the stability and road handling of vehicles. Corrective yaw moment action should be applied to a vehicle in order to improve the vehicle dynamic performance. The corrective yaw moment is directly related to the interaction between the tires and road, which could either be generated directly or indirectly. Subsequently, the performance of the yaw moment control system, in low-friction road conditions, would noticeably be reduced. An innovative method is proposed to generate the corrective yaw moment by utilizing a momentum wheel that works independent of the tire\/road interaction. A comprehensive dynamic analysis of this model, when is integrated with a direct yaw moment control system, has been carried out. Computer simulation results for the vehicle model combined with an integrated momentum wheel and differential braking, under different road conditions, are presented.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This experiment attempted to identify the features of air traffic geometry that would influence the difficulty and biases of pilots' conflict detection using a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI). BACKGROUND: There was previously no systematic study on effects of such features on conflict detection using the CDTI. METHOD: Twenty-four pilots viewed dynamic encounters between their own aircraft and an intruder aircraft on a simulated CDTI; difficulty was varied by the intruder aircraft's distance and time to closest point of approach (CPA), relative speed, miss distance at CPA, approach side, and conflict angle. Participants estimated the intruder's location at, and its time to, CPA. Effects on three estimation error measures were explored: intruder's miss distance at CPA, orientation at CPA, and time to CPA. RESULTS: (a) Estimation errors increased with slower speeds, longer times to CPA, and longer distances to CPA and with longer miss distances at CPA; (b) the best performance occurred at a conflict angle of 90 degrees; (c) there was a bias to judge conflicts to be more risky than was actually the case; and (d) there was a \"distance-over-speed\" bias, such that two aircraft farther apart and converging rapidly were perceived as less risky than when they were closer to each other and converging at a slower rate, despite identical time to CPA. CONCLUSION: Pilots' conflict detection with CDTI was subject to various errors and biases, which has important safety implications.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the human response to motion-cuing algorithms (MCAs) by comparing users' perception to several proposed objective indicators. BACKGROUND: Other researchers have proposed several MCAs, but few improvements have been achieved lately. One of the reasons for this lack of progress is that fair comparisons between different algorithms are hard to achieve, for their evaluation needs to be performed with humans and the tuning process is slow. METHOD: This characterization is performed by means of a comparison of the subjective perception of vehicle simulation users (90 participants) against several proposed objective indicators that try to measure MCA performance. Two motion platforms (3 and 6 degrees of freedom [DoF]) and two vehicle simulators (a driving simulator and a speedboat simulator) were tested using the classical washout algorithm, considered to be the main reference in MCA literature. RESULTS: Results show that users are more sensitive to correlation and delay with respect to the expected motion rather than its magnitude and that specific force is more of a factor than angular speed in the driving simulator. The opposite happens in the speedboat simulator. CONCLUSIONS: Human drivers' reaction to MCA is mainly characterized by the normalized Pearson correlation between output and input signals of the algorithm. This finding validates the main MCA strategy that consists of downscaling the signals and slightly distorting their frequency spectrum. The 6-DoF simulator is perceived as a modest improvement of the 3-DoF platform.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of hearing loss, aviation headset type, flight workload complexity, and communication signal quality on pilots' performance in an army rotary-wing flight simulator. BACKGROUND: To maintain flight status, army aviators who do not meet current audiometric standards require a hearing loss waiver, which is based on speech intelligibility in quiet conditions. Because hearing loss characteristics of hearing-impaired aviators can vary greatly, and because performance is likely also influenced by degree of flight workload and communication demand, it was expected that performance among hearing-impaired aviators would also vary. METHOD: Participants were 20 army helicopter pilots. Pilots flew three flights in a full motion-based helicopter simulator,with a different headset configuration and varying flight workload levels and communication signal quality characterizing each flight. Objective flight performance parameters of heading, altitude, and airspeed deviation and air traffic control command read-backs were measured. RESULTS: Statistically significant results suggest that high levels of flight workload, especially in combination with poor communications signal quality, lead to deficits in flight performance and speech intelligibility. CONCLUSION: These results support a conclusion that factors other than hearing thresholds and speech intelligibility in quiet should be considered when evaluating helicopter pilots' flight safety. The results also support a recommendation that hearing-impaired pilots use assistive communication technology and not fly with strictly passive headsets. APPLICATION: The combined effects of flight environment with individual hearing levels should be considered when making recommendations concerning continued aviation flight status and those concerning communications headsets used in high-noise cockpits.

{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of cyberbullying experiences among public and private school students in Turkey. One hundred eighty-three participants between the ages of 14 and 15 were recruited for the study. Participants were asked to respond to questionnaires measuring demographic information, usage frequency of Internet-mediated communication tools (IMCT), and cyberbullying experience (as a victim and as a bully). Participants who reported cyberbullying victimization were also asked how they felt and whether they sought help after such experiences. Results indicated that public school students were more likely than private school students to report being cyberbullies and cybervictims despite that private school students were more likely than public school students to report more frequent usage of IMCT. The findings of the logistic regression analyses indicated that usage frequency of IMCT was a significant predictor of cyberbullying\/victimization for public school students but not for private school students. While victims from private school revealed that they did not mind the cyberbullying experience because they thought it was a joke, victims from public school reported that they felt angry when they experienced cyberbullying. Both public and private schools indicated that friends were their first choice for help.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of different driving scenarios (urban, rural, highway) on the timing required by drivers from a two-stage warning system, based on car-to-car communication. BACKGROUND: Car-to-car communication systems are designed to inform drivers of potential hazards at an early stage, before they are visible to them. Here, questions arise as to how drivers acknowledge early warnings and when they should be informed (first stage) and warned (second stage). Hence, optimum timing for presenting the information was tested. METHOD: A psychophysical method was used to establish the optimum timing in three driving scenarios at different speed limits (urban: 50 km\/h, rural: 100 km\/h, highway: 130 km\/h). A total of 24 participants (11 female, 13 male; M = 29.1 years, SD = 11.6 years) participated in the study. RESULTS: The results showed that the optimum timing did not differ among the three scenarios.The first and second stages should ultimately be presented at different timings at each speed limit (first stage: 26.5 s, second stage: 12.1 s before a potential hazard). CONCLUSION: The results showed that well-selected timing for activating information and warning is crucial for the acceptance of these systems. Appropriate timing for presenting the information and warning can be derived for these systems.

BACKGROUND: Psychophysical studies on repetitive motions of the wrist and hand were previously reported on women; however, it is not clear how men will psychophysically respond to similar motions. METHOD: A psychophysical methodology was used in which the participant adjusted the resistance on the handle. Repetition rates for these tasks were 15 and 25 per minute. Participants performed the tasks for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week, and for 12 days. Symptoms were recorded by the subjects at the end of each hour.

BACKGROUND: A recent study that evaluated comprehension of traffic signs in four different countries showed that comprehension level varies widely and is apparently related to the extent that the sign's design incorporates ergonomic guidelines for good design (D. Shinar, R. E. Dewar, H. Summala, and L. Zakowska 2003). METHOD: Participants were presented with 30 signs and asked to describe each sign's meaning. They then evaluated each sign in terms of each of three ergonomic principles. In addition, a group of human factors\/ergonomics experts evaluated each sign on its standardization and compatibility. RESULTS: There were high correlations between the ratings of the students and the ratings of the experts on compatibility (rho = .94) and on standardization (rho = .84), validating the use of the students' evaluations of the signs on these variables. There was a great variability in signs' comprehension and high and statistically significant correlations between the comprehension level of each sign and the extent to which it complied with compatibility (R = .76), familiarity (R = .89), and standardization (R = .88) principles.

BACKGROUND: Klein and Hoffman distinguished several forms of causal explanations for indeterminate, complex situations: single-cause explanations, lists of causes, and explanations that interrelate several causes. What governs our preferences for single-cause (simple) versus multiple- cause (complex) explanations? METHOD: In three experiments, we examined the effect of target audience, explanatory context, participant nationality, and explanation type. All participants were college students. Participants were given two scenarios, one regarding the U.S. economic collapse in 2007 to 2008 and the other about the sudden success of the U.S. military in Iraq in 2007. The participants were asked to assess various types of causal explanations for each of the scenarios, with reference to one or more purposes or audience for the explanations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper's first objective is to determine whether motor priming assistance (consisting of directional steering wheel vibrations) can be of some benefit compared with more traditional auditory (lateralized sound) or vibratory (symmetric steering wheel oscillation) warning devices. We hypothesize that warning devices favor driving situation diagnosis, whereas motor priming can improve the initiation of action even further. Another objective is to assess the possible benefits of using multimodal information by combining auditory warning with simple steering wheel vibration or motor priming. BACKGROUND: Within the context of active safety devices, the experiment dealt with moderately intrusive driving assistance devices that intervene when a certain level of risk in terms of lane departure is reached. METHOD: An analysis of the steering behavior of 20 participants following episodes of visual occlusion was carried out. Five warning and motor priming devices were compared. RESULTS: All tested devices improved the drivers' steering performance, although their effects were modulated by the drivers' risk assessment. However, performance improvements were found to be greater with a motor priming device. No additional performance enhancement was observed when auditory warning was added to steering wheel vibration or motor priming devices. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the hypothesis that the direct intervention of motor priming at the action level is more effective than a simple warning, which intervenes upstream in situation diagnosis. Multimodal information did not seem to improve driver performance.

BACKGROUND: In 1947, in anticipation of augmented contact and sensor-relayed contact displays, a periscope was installed in an airplane to serve as a sensor-based contact display simulator. To achieve normal landing performance, however, the unity image had to be magnified. This successful intervention, first published in 1966 in Human Factors, implicated oculomotor mechanisms and higher perceptual functions and became the observational basis for a series of investigative hypotheses. METHOD: Observers registered the perceived size of the collimated image of a\"moon\"by adjusting a disk of light while alternatively providing optometric measurements of accommodative distance. RESULTS: Various investigators found high correlations between focal distances and perceived moon sizes. CONCLUSION: The simulated moon provided a superior vehicle for revealing the relationship between focal distance and perceived size and the factors affecting both. The operational display design implications and the possibility of a partial explanation for the moon illusion provided the motivation for an important doctoral research project involving eight factors that affect both focal distance and perceived size. APPLICATION: The investigation reaffirmed that virtual images, as found in head-up and head-mounted displays (HUDs and HMDs, respectively), do not consistently draw focus to optical infinity and that a variety of factors necessarily manipulated by display designers and present in many operational systems can affect visual performance partially through the mediation of accommodation.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we explored the state versus trait aspects of measures of task and team workload in a disaster simulation. BACKGROUND: There is often a need to assess workload in both individual and collaborative settings. Researchers in this field often use the NASATask Load Index (NASA-TLX) as a global measure of workload by aggregating the NASA-TLX's component items. Using this practice, one may overlook the distinction between traits and states. METHOD: Fifteen dyadic teams (11 inexperienced, 4 experienced) completed five sessions of a tsunami disaster simulator. After every session, individuals completed a modified version of the NASA-TLX that included team workload measures.We then examined the workload items by using a between-subjects and within-subjects perspective. RESULTS: Between-subjects and within-subjects correlations among the items indicated the workload items are more independent within subjects (as states) than between subjects (as traits). Correlations between the workload items and simulation performance were also different at the trait and state levels. CONCLUSION: Workload may behave differently at trait (between-subjects) and state (within-subjects) levels. APPLICATION: Researchers interested in workload measurement as a state should take a within-subjects perspective in their analyses. Language: en","authors":["William S. Helton","Gregory J.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: White matter (WM) integrity declines with normal aging. Physical activity may attenuate age-related WM integrity changes and improve cognitive function. This study examined brain WM integrity in Masters athletes who have engaged in life-long aerobic exercise training. We tested the hypothesis that life-long aerobic training is associated with improved brain WM integrity in older adults. METHODS: Ten Masters athletes (3 females, age=72.2\u00b15.3yrs, endurance training>15yrs) and 10 sedentary older adults similar in age and educational level (2 females, age=74.5\u00b14.3yrs) participated. MRI fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired to assess white matter hyper intensities (WMH) volume. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to evaluate the WM microstructural integrity with a DTI-derived metric, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). RESULTS: After normalization to whole-brain volume, Masters athletes showed an 83% reduction in deep WMH volume relative to their sedentary counterparts (0.05 \u00b1 0.05% vs. 0.29 \u00b1 0.29%, p Language: en","authors":["Benjamin Y.

{"abstract":"There is an ongoing debate in the literature whether problematic Internet use (PIU) and problematic online gaming (POG) are two distinct conceptual and nosological entities or whether they are the same. The present study contributes to this question by examining the interrelationship and the overlap between PIU and POG in terms of sex, school achievement, time spent using the Internet and\/or online gaming, psychological well-being, and preferred online activities. Questionnaires assessing these variables were administered to a nationally representative sample of adolescent gamers (N=2,073; Mage=16.4 years, SD=0.87; 68.4% male). Data showed that Internet use was a common activity among adolescents, while online gaming was engaged in by a considerably smaller group. Similarly, more adolescents met the criteria for PIU than for POG, and a small group of adolescents showed symptoms of both problem behaviors. The most notable difference between the two problem behaviors was in terms of sex. POG was much more strongly associated with being male. Self-esteem had low effect sizes on both behaviors, while depressive symptoms were associated with both PIU and POG, affecting PIU slightly more. In terms of preferred online activities, PIU was positively associated with online gaming, online chatting, and social networking, while POG was only associated with online gaming. Based on our findings, POG appears to be a conceptually different behavior from PIU, and therefore the data support the notion that Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder are separate nosological entities.

BACKGROUND: The driving literature is ambiguous as to whether practice can reduce driver distraction from concurrent cell phone conversation. METHODS: Drivers reporting either high or low real-world cell phone usage were selected to participate in four 90-min simulated driving sessions on successive days. The research consisted of two phases: a practice phase and a novel transfer phase. RESULTS: Dual-task performance deficits persisted through practice and transfer driving conditions. Moreover, groups reporting high and low real-world experience exhibited similar driving impairments when conversing on a hands-free cell phone.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) cues in improving driving safety among elderly drivers who are at increased crash risk because of cognitive impairments. BACKGROUND: Cognitively challenging driving environments pose a particular crash risk for elderly drivers. AR cuing is a promising technology to mitigate risk by directing driver attention to roadway hazards. We investigate whether AR cues improve or interfere with hazard perception in elderly drivers with age-related cognitive decline. METHOD: A total of 20 elderly (M = 73 years, SD = 5) licensed drivers with a range of cognitive abilities measured by a speed-of-processing (SOP) composite participated in a 1-hr drive in an interactive, fixed-base driving simulator. Each participant drove through six straight, 6-mile-long, rural roadway scenarios following a lead vehicle. AR cues directed attention to potential roadside hazards in three of the scenarios, and the other three were uncued (baseline) drives. Effects of AR cuing were evaluated with respect to (a) detection of hazardous target objects, (b) interference with detecting nonhazardous secondary objects, and (c) impairment in maintaining safe distance behind a lead vehicle. RESULTS: AR cuing improved the detection of hazardous target objects of low visibility. AR cues did not interfere with detection of nonhazardous secondary objects and did not impair ability to maintain safe distance behind a lead vehicle (close following). SOP capacity did not moderate those effects. CONCLUSION: AR cues show promise for improving elderly driver safety by increasing hazard detection likelihood without interfering with other driving tasks, such as maintaining safe headway.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess whether a concurrent but independent navigation task exacerbates the effects of hearing loss on speech recognition and whether hearing loss degrades performance of the navigation task during the concurrent but independent listening task. BACKGROUND: Navigation performance and speech comprehension both decrease when a driver follows hard-to-hear concurrent verbal instructions. It remains unknown how much both tasks would be affected when performed concurrently, if tasks were independent. METHOD: Participants performed a listening task by responding to Callsign Acquisition Test (CAT) stimuli at three simulated hearing levels. For each hearing level, one trial was performed with the participant standing still and another trial was performed while navigating a path in a virtual environment using a handheld map. In one more trial, participants navigated a path with no CAT. The proportion of call signs correctly repeated and the total time required to walk the path were measured. RESULTS: CAT scores showed an expected negative effect of hearing loss. Concurrent navigation produced an even larger decrease in CAT score. Hearing loss caused a slight but not significant decrease in navigation task performance. CONCLUSION: A person with hearing loss may communicate less effectively while walking than predicted on the basis of hearing loss alone. The hearing loss, however, does not significantly decrease walking performance in a simple navigation task.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: As the world's most dangerous profession, sea fishing enables discussion of the concept of resilience and its articulation to the notion of safety in complex systems. BACKGROUND: In the small, emerging community working on this concept, the prevailing idea to improve safety is that resilience must be reinjected into the know-how of complex systems. METHOD: Thirty-four male skippers, divided into two groups, took part in an interactive simulation of a fishing campaign. They had to make decisions in situations of trade-off between safety and production goals. RESULTS: From the time they left the harbor, the fishermen never gave up on fishing, even in extreme conditions, and regardless of whether or not the catch was good. Not being suicidal, however, they used multiple expert strategies to reduce risk without giving up on their fishing activity. CONCLUSION: Systems run by craftspeople are very resilient because they rely on a high level of adaptability, based on the actors' expertise, linked to an exposure to frequent and considerable risk. Each actor is responsible for his or her own safety. The final discussion bears on the question of knowing whether or not it is possible to design a safe system while preserving its craftsmanship and therefore its native resilience. APPLICATION: The results of these studies suggest potential adverse effects of classic safety interventions in complex sociotechnical systems either in terms of professional reluctance to accept new recommendations or through the emergence of new sources of risk.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt the Crew Resource Management (CRM) Attitudes Questionnaire (CMAQ) to the maritime domain, to assess the ship management attitudes of junior naval officers, and to determine the extent to which these attitudes correlate with behavior and performance in a naval exercise. BACKGROUND: CRM attitudes have been shown to be associated with performance in aviation, but it is unclear whether this construct is applicable and relevant to the maritime domain. METHOD: Participants were 121 active seafarers and 101 junior officers of the German Navy who completed the Ship Management Attitudes Questionnaire-German Navy (SMAQ-GN). Ratings of nontechnical skills and ratings of mission success of the junior officers were collected during a real-world naval exercise. RESULTS: Internal consistencies of SMAQ-GN were similar to those of the original CMAQ and retest reliability was rather high. Attitudes of junior officers toward communication and coordination were positive. Regarding command responsibility and the recognition of stressor effects, positive as well as neutral and negative attitudes were found. Overall, attitudes did not correlate with behavior and performance. Separate analysis of those participants reporting negative to neutral ship management attitudes showed substantial positive correlations of attitudes with behavior and performance. CONCLUSION: Ship management attitudes play a significant role in commanding ships. The attitude-performance linkage is not linear. Behavior and performance are less effective in officers with negative attitudes and equally effective in officers with slightly positive and very positive attitudes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a computational model of the automation complacency effect, as operators work on a robotic arm task, supported by three different degrees of automation. BACKGROUND: Some computational models of complacency in human-automation interaction exist, but those are formed and validated within the context of fairly simplified monitoring failures. This research extends model validation to a much more complex task, so that system designers can establish, without need for human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimentation, merits and shortcomings of different automation degrees. METHOD: We developed a realistic simulation of a space-based robotic arm task that could be carried out with three different levels of trajectory visualization and execution automation support. Using this simulation, we performed HITL testing. Complacency was induced via several trials of correctly performing automation and then was assessed on trials when automation failed. Following a cognitive task analysis of the robotic arm operation, we developed a multicomponent model of the robotic operator and his or her reliance on automation, based in part on visual scanning. RESULTS: The comparison of model predictions with empirical results revealed that the model accurately predicted routine performance and predicted the responses to these failures after complacency developed. However, the scanning models do not account for the entire attention allocation effects of complacency. APPLICATIONS: Complacency modeling can provide a useful tool for predicting the effects of different types of imperfect automation. The results from this research suggest that focus should be given to supporting situation awareness in automation development. Language: en","authors":["Christopher D.

{"abstract":"The objective of the study was to investigate the validity of 3D-accelerometry-based Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score estimation. In particular, acceleration patterns of BBS tasks and gait were targets of analysis. Accelerations of the lower back were measured during execution of the BBS test and corridor-walking for 54 subjects, consisting of neurological patients, older adults, and healthy young persons. The BBS score was estimated from 1-3 BBS tasks and from gait-related data, separately, through assessment of the similarity of acceleration patterns between subjects. The work also validated both approaches' ability to classify subjects into high- and low-fall-risk groups. The gait-based method yielded the best BBS score estimates and the most accurate BBS-task-based estimates were produced with the stand to sit, reaching, and picking object tasks. The proposed gait-based method can identify subjects with high or low risk of falling with an accuracy of 77.8% and 96.6%, respectively, and the BBS-task-based method with corresponding accuracy of 89.5% and 62.1%.

{"abstract":"In a previous study (Lotze et al., 2007) we described dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation in healthy subjects during retaliation in a competitive reaction time task. Interestingly, the less callous the subjects were, the more they responded with ventral mPFC-activation when watching the opponent suffering. In this study we used this paradigm to investigate behavioral and neural responding of ten criminal psychopathic individuals from a forensic psychiatric institution. In contrast to healthy subjects, who show reactive aggressive behavior of inflicting punishment with increasing intensity after experiencing an increasing amount of punishment from a yoked opponent, psychopathic participants did not react with comparable retaliation. However, when psychopaths punished with a high amount they showed increased activation in the hypothalamus, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala. The trait \"physical aggression\" showed a positive correlation with hypothalamic activation. Medial prefrontal areas, associated with emotional control and conflict management in healthy subjects performing this paradigm, were inactive in psychopathic subjects during retaliation. When psychopaths observed the yoked opponent being punished they showed increased activation in the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which was positively associated by impulsivity and antisocial behavior of Hare's psychopathy construct. This finding supports the notion that reactive aggression is more related to antisocial behavior and anger management than with emotional and interpersonal characteristics of psychopathy and suggests that two separate brain activation patterns seem to account for these two behavioral dispositions.

BACKGROUND: Considerable engineering effort has been devoted to developing force augmented reality (AR) systems to assist users in delicate procedures like microsurgery. In contrast, far less has been done to characterize the behavioral outcomes of these systems, and no research has systematically examined the impact of sensory and perceptual processes on force augmentation effectiveness. METHOD: Using a handheld force magnifier as an exemplar haptic AR, we conducted three experiments to characterize its utility in the perception of force and stiffness. Experiments 1 and 2 measured, respectively, the user's ability to detect and differentiate weak force (RESULTS: The user's ability to detect and differentiate small forces was significantly improved by augmentation at both threshold and suprathreshold levels. The augmentation also enhanced stiffness perception. However, although perception of augmented forces matches that of the physical equivalent for weak forces, it falls off with increasing intensity. CONCLUSION: The loss in the effectiveness reflects the nature of sensory and perceptual processing. Such perceptual limitations should be taken into consideration in the design and development of haptic AR systems to maximize utility.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this work, we expand on the theory of adaptive aiding by measuring the effectiveness of coadaptive aiding, wherein we explicitly allow for both system and user to adapt to each other. BACKGROUND: Adaptive aiding driven by psychophysiological monitoring has been demonstrated to be a highly effective means of controlling task allocation and system functioning. Psychophysiological monitoring is uniquely well suited for coadaptation, as malleable brain activity may be used as a continuous input to the adaptive system. METHOD: To establish the efficacy of the coadaptive system, physiological activation of adaptation was directly compared with manual activation or no activation of the same automation and cuing systems. We used interface adaptations and automation that are plausible for real-world operations, presented in the context of a multi-remotely piloted aircraft control simulation. Each participant completed 3 days of testing during 1 week. Performance was assessed via proportion of targets successfully engaged. RESULTS: In the first 2 days of testing, there were no significant differences in performance between the conditions. However, in the third session, physiological adaptation produced the highest performance.

{"abstract":"Accessibility is a concept that has become central to physical planning and spatial modelling for more than fifty years. As measure of the relative nearness or proximity of one place and persons to all other places or persons, conceptually linked to Newton's law of gravity, its origins can be traced back to the 1920s when it was used in location theory and regional economic planning (Batty, 2009) and retail planning (Stewart, 1948). In his classic paper, Hansen (1959) was the first to define accessibility as a potential of opportunities for interaction and applied the concept to forecast employment developments in Washington D.C. Hansen's gravity-based measure of accessibility was a generalization of the concept of population potential, which was based on the notion of potential in physics systems by Stewart (1948). Since then, accessibility analyses have addressed the issue of spatial interaction. Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) provide an explicit link between accessibility modelling, and economic, demographic and transport flows. SIMs have a long history and have been used in a wide variety of contexts. Wilson (1970) gave SIMs theoretical strength by deriving them using the entropy maximization approach, and the doubly-constrained form formed the bases for transport flow modelling. The formal equivalence between SIMs and logit models\/micro-economic theory was shown by Anas (1983). The accessibility function can be directly derived from SIMs and it therefore contains SIM behavioural cost components ( Reggiani, 2014). Moreover, the relevance of topological\/connectivity structures in the accessibility analyses has, in some way, been anticipated by Weibull (1980), who considered accessibility as a property of configuration of opportunities for spatial interaction. Accessibility models have in the past decades been applied in several academic fields such as urban geography, rural geography, health geography, time geography, spatial economics and transport engineering. Many different applications have been developed in these fields and can be categorized in several ways. Here, we use the categorization of accessibility measures from the well-cited review paper from Geurs and Van Wee (2004). They provide an overview of components of accessibility and perspectives on accessibility, which we will use as a categorization of accessibility measures. Geurs and Van Wee distinguish four basic perspectives on accessibility: (i) infrastructure-based measures, analyzing the performance or service level of transport infrastructure, (ii) location-based measures, analyzing accessibility of spatially distributed activities, typically on an aggregate level, (iii) person-based measures, founded in the space-time geography, analyzing accessibility at the level of the individual level, and (iv) utility-based measures, analyzing the welfare benefits that people derive from levels of access to the spatially distributed activities. These perspectives focus on one or several of the four components of accessibility distinguished by Geurs and Van Wee: (i) the land-use component reflecting the amount, quality and spatial distribution of opportunities, (ii) the transportation component describing the disutility of travel in terms of time, cost and effort, (iii) the temporal component reflecting the temporal constraints and variability, and (iv) the individual component reflecting the needs, and abilities of individuals. Here, we describe the directions which academic literature in the recent years took to improve the treatment of the four components in accessibility modelling....

{"abstract":"Anticholinesterase poisoning is an important health problem in our country, and a complete understanding of its underlying mechanisms is essential for the emergency physician. So, this study focused on two purposes. First one was aimed to investigate the biochemical analysis to determine the tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione and nitric oxide (NO). Secondly, it was planned to model and formulate the effects of some drugs on cardiac tissues levels of NO, MDA and glutathione in acute organophosphate poisoning in rats by the application of neural network based on experimental results. It has been planned to determine whether artificial neural network (ANN) is appropriate tool to analyze and formulate it. As a result, it has been considered that ANN can be effectively used to model NO, MDA and glutathione level. The performances of ANN formulation versus target experimental values are found to be quite high. It is concluded that, proposed NN models are also presented as simple explicit mathematical functions for further use by researchers.

{"abstract":"Studies of risky decision-making have demonstrated that humans typically prefer risky options after incurring a financial loss, while generally preferring safer options after a monetary gain. Here, we examined the neural processes underlying these inconsistent risk preferences by investigating the evaluation of gains and losses, and demonstrating how these responses can impact subsequent preference for either risky or safe choice options. Participants performed a task while undergoing fMRI in which they experienced both gains and losses. Immediately following a gain or loss, participants decided to either play or pass on a \"double-or-quits\" gamble. The outcome of the gamble could either double or eliminate their initial gain (from the time-estimation task) or redeem or double their initial loss. If they chose not to play this gamble, they retained the initial gain or loss. We demonstrate a shift in risk-taking preferences for identical sets of gambles as a function of previous gains or losses, with participants showing a greater preference towards riskier decisions in the context of a prior loss. An interaction between evaluating gain\/loss contexts and subsequent behavioral risk pattern revealed an increased BOLD response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with stronger responses for both gambling in a loss context and safety in a gain context. This suggests that the vmPFC is responsible for integrating these contextual effects, with these processes impacting on subsequent risky choice. Language: en","authors":["Annabel B.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the influence of ongoing task display\"compellingness\"on attention allocation patterns and assessed its interaction with interrupting task salience and importance. BACKGROUND: There are some concerns that the compellingness of flight deck tunnel displays renders the task they support more resistant to interruptions, thus preventing the pilot from noticing cues signaling the need to divert attention to other tasks. METHODS: Forty pilots flew three curved approaches in a high-fidelity simulation using a synthetic vision system (SVS) display. In addition to the primary task of flying, during the last approach they were required to select the approach path on the basis of environmental information concerning weather. The display layout supporting the primary flight task (tunnel vs. baseline display), the nature of the cue signaling the need to divert attention to the path selection task (visual vs. auditory-visual cue), and the cost of not performing the secondary task were manipulated to investigate their influence on task prioritization. RESULTS: The modality and priority of the cue affected the frequency of the switch to the secondary task. Furthermore, pilots flying with a tunnel display were more likely to detect the change in the weather and were easily interrupted by the secondary task when priority was high. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that some of the concerns regarding the negative consequences of the compelling nature of the tunnel display may not be as pronounced as thought.

{"abstract":"The cerebellum is thought to be engaged not only in motor control, but also in the neural network dedicated to visual processing of body motion. However, the pattern of connectivity within this network, in particular, between the cortical circuitry for observation of others' actions and the cerebellum remains largely unknown. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity analysis and dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we assessed cerebro-cerebellar connectivity during a visual perceptual task with point-light displays depicting human locomotion. In the left lateral cerebellum, regions in the lobules Crus I and VIIB exhibited increased fMRI response to biological motion. The outcome of the connectivity analyses delivered the first evidence for reciprocal communication between the left lateral cerebellum and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Through communication with the right posterior STS that is as a key node not only for biological motion perception but also for social interaction and visual tasks on theory of mind, the left cerebellum might be involved in a wide range of social cognitive functions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In a simulated combat vehicle, uni-, bi-, and trimodal cueing of direction to threat were compared with the purpose to investigate whether multisensory redundant information may enhance dynamic perception and performance. BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that multimodal display presentation can enhance perception of information and task performance. METHOD: Two experiments in a simulated combat vehicle were performed under the instructions to turn the vehicle toward the threat as fast and accurately as possible after threat cue onset. In Experiment 1, direction to threat was presented by four display types: visual head-down display, tactile belt, 3-D audio, and trimodal with the three displays combined. In Experiment 2, direction to threat was presented by three display types: visual head-up display (HUD)-3-D audio, tactile belt-3-D audio, and trimodal with HUD, tactile belt, and 3-D audio combined. RESULTS: In Experiment I,the trimodal display provided overall best performance and perception of threat direction. In Experiment 2, both the trimodal and HUD--3-D audio displays led to overall best performance, and the trimodal display provided overall the best perception of threat direction. None of the trimodal displays induced higher mental workload or secondary task interference. CONCLUSION: The trimodal displays provided overall enhanced perception and performance in the dynamically framed threat scenario and did not entail higher mental workload or decreased spare capacity. APPLICATION: Trimodal displays with redundant information may contribute to safer and more reliable peak performance in time-critical dynamic tasks and especially in more extreme and stressful situations with high perceptual or mental workload.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effectiveness of a theoretically motivated intervention at reducing procedural errors in train yard operations, where making these errors could be costly or life-threatening. BACKGROUND: A widespread and persistent memory error that people commit on a daily basis is the postcompletion error (PCE), that is, forgetting to complete the final step of a procedural task in which the final step occurs after completion of the task goal. PCEs occur in the railroad industry when a locomotive conductor changes the direction of a rail switch but fails to report this change. This particular error could contribute to unsafe conditions as another train traveling on the same track could derail. Although training can help reduce some of the factors leading to unsafe conditions on the rail, research has demonstrated that PCEs are different from other errors of omission in that they cannot be eliminated through training, which makes them a difficult problem to address. METHOD: Twenty-eight undergraduates completed train yard tasks within a mid-fidelity simulator used in commercial rail operations for training. Each participant received the behavioral intervention in one block and no intervention in another. Specifically, participants were required to perform an additional task designed to remind participants of the postcompletion step. RESULTS: Our intervention significantly reduced PCE rates in the context of train yard operations, on average by 65%. CONCLUSION: We discuss implications of the effectiveness of our intervention at reducing train yard accidents and how this outcome can contribute to the literature on the cause of PCEs. APPLICATION: In cases such as the railroad industry, where redesigning technology is prohibitive, our behavioral intervention is an effective alternative for significantly reducing PCEs.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the low visibility of motorcycles is the result of their low cognitive conspicuity and\/or their low sensory conspicuity for car drivers. BACKGROUND: In several cases of collision between a car and a motorcycle, the car driver failed to detect the motorcyclist in time to avoid the collision. METHOD: To test the low cognitive conspicuity hypothesis, 42 car drivers (32.02 years old) including 21 motorcyclist motorists and 21 non-motorcyclist motorists carried out a motorcycle detection task in a car-driving simulator.To test the low sensory conspicuity hypothesis, the authors studied the effect of the color contrast between motorcycles and the road surface on the ability of car drivers to detect motorcycles when they appear from different parts of the road. RESULTS: A high level of color contrast enhanced the visibility of motorcycles when they appeared in front of the participants. Moreover, when motorcyclists appeared from behind the participants,the motorcyclist motorists detected oncoming motorcycles at a greater distance than did the non-motorcyclist motorists. Motorcyclist motorists carry out more saccades and rapidly capture information (on their rearview mirrors and on the road in front of them).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to examine the utility of a self-report tool that was designed as a partial substitute for a face-to-face cognitive interview for critical incidents involving night vision goggles (NVGs). BACKGROUND: The use of NVGs remains problematic within the military environment, as these devices have been identified as a factor in a significant proportion of aircraft accidents and incidents. The self-report tool was structured to identify some of the cognitive features of human performance that were associated with critical incidents involving NVGs. The tool incorporated a number of different levels of analysis, ranging from specific behavioral responses to broader cognitive constructs. METHOD: Reports were received from 30 active pilots within the Australian Army using the NVG Critical Incident Assessment Tool (NVGCIAT). RESULTS: The results revealed a correspondence between specific types of NVG-related errors and elements of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). In addition, uncertainty emerged as a significant factor associated with the critical incidents that were recalled by operators.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective is to demonstrate how the Human View architecture can be used to define and evaluate the human interoperability capabilities of a net-centric system. Human interoperability strives to understand the types of system relationships that affect collaboration across networked environments. BACKGROUND: The Human View was developed as an additional system architectural viewpoint to focus on the human component of a system by capturing data on human roles, tasks, constraints, interactions, and metrics.This framework can be used to collect and organize social system parameters to facilitate the way that humans interact across organizational boundaries. METHOD: By mapping the Human View elements to organizational relationships defined in the domain of network theory, a network model of the Human View can be developed.This representation can then be aligned with a Layers of Interoperability model for collaborative systems.The model extends traditional technical interoperability to include organizational aspects important for human interoperability. The resulting composite model can be used to evaluate the human interoperability capability of network-enabled systems. RESULTS: An interagency response to a crisis situation is an example where increased levels of human interoperability can affect the effectiveness of the organizational interactions. The existing Human View products representing the interagency capabilities were evaluated using the network model to demonstrate how the social system variables can be identified and evaluated to improve the system design.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evaluation was to evaluate the causes and costs of slips, trips, and falls (STFs) in a helicopter manufacturing plant. BACKGROUND: STFs are a significant portion of the total industry injury burden. METHOD: For this study, 4,070 helicopter plant workers who were employed from January 1, 2004, through February 28, 2008, were enrolled. Company records on workers' compensation claims, occupational health first report of injury, and payroll records on hours worked were collected. Cause and source of all injuries, including STFs, were coded for analysis. RESULTS: During the 4-year study period, there were 2,378 injuries and 226 STFs (46 falls [20%] to a lower level, 117 [52%] falls on the same level, 41 [18%] from loss of balance without a fall, and 22 [10%] from other events). Of the 226 STFs, 123 falls to the same level were caused by slippery substances (52), objects on floor (43), and surface hazards (28), and they cost $1,543,946. Falls to lower levels primarily involved access to stands to and from aircraft and falling off large machines. CONCLUSION: More than half of the STF injury claims likely could have been prevented by housekeeping and maintenance, and this cost saving could reasonably offset a considerable portion of the cost of prevention.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: It was proposed that misuse and disuse often occur because operators (a) cannot determine if automation or a nonautomated alternative maximizes the likelihood of task success (appraisal errors) or (b) know the utilities of the options but disregard this information when deciding to use automation (intent errors). OBJECTIVE: This investigation assessed the effectiveness of performance feedback, a procedure developed to attenuate appraisal errors, and scenario training, an intervention designed to decrease intent errors. METHODS: Operators given feedback were told how many errors they and an automated device made on a target detection task. Scenario training took operators through the thought processes of optimal decision makers after the utilities of the automated and nonautomated alternatives had been determined. Following 200 training trials, participants chose between relying on their observations or an automated device. RESULTS: There was little misuse, but disuse rates were high (84%) among operators receiving neither feedback nor scenario training. Operators paired with a more accurate machine and given feedback made approximately twice as many errors as the automated device. Nevertheless, intent errors were commonplace; 55% of the operators who received feedback without scenario training did not rely on automation. Feedback effectiveness was enhanced when used in conjunction with scenario training; the disuse rate decreased to 29%. CONCLUSION: A combination of feedback and scenario training was more effective in mitigating disuse than either intervention used in isolation.

{"abstract":"The effect of recent experience on current behavior has been studied extensively in simple laboratory tasks. We explore the nature of sequential effects in the more naturalistic setting of automobile driving. Driving is a safety-critical task in which delayed response times may have severe consequences. Using a realistic driving simulator, we find significant sequential effects in pedal-press response times that depend on the history of recent stimuli and responses. Response times are slowed up to 100 ms in particular cases, a delay that has dangerous practical consequences. Further, we observe a significant number of history-related pedal misapplications, which have recently been noted as a cause for concern in the automotive safety community.

{"abstract":"This paper describes recent progress on Crosswatch, a smartphone-based computer vision system developed by the authors for providing guidance to blind and visually impaired pedestrians at traffic intersections. One of Crosswatch's key capabilities is determining the user's location (with precision much better than what is obtainable by GPS) and orientation relative to the crosswalk markings in the intersection that he\/she is currently standing at; this capability will be used to help him\/her find important features in the intersection, such as walk lights, pushbuttons and crosswalks, and achieve proper alignment to these features. We report on two new contributions to Crosswatch: (a) experiments with a modified user interface, tested by blind volunteer participants, that makes it easier to acquire intersection images than with previous versions of Crosswatch; and (b) a demonstration of the system's ability to localize the user with precision better than what is obtainable by GPS, as well as an example of its ability to estimate the user's orientation.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the performance of a manual tracking task with system flexibility and time delays in the input channel and to examine the effects of input shaping the human operator's commands. BACKGROUND: It has long been known that low-frequency, lightly damped vibration hinders performance of a manually controlled system. Recently, input shaping has been shown to improve the performance of such systems in a compensatory-display tracking task. It is unknown if similar improvements are seen with pursuit-display tasks, or how the improvement changes when time delays are added to the system. METHOD: A total of 18 novice participants performed a pursuit-view tracking experiment with a spring-centered joystick. Controlled elements included an integrator, an integrator with a lightly damped flexible mode, and an input-shaped integrator with a flexible mode. The input to these controlled elements was delayed between 0 and 1 s. Tracking performance was quantified by root mean square tracking error, and subjective difficulty was quantified by ratings on a Cooper-Harper scale. RESULTS: Performance was best with the undelayed integrator. Both time delay and flexibility degraded performance. Input shaping improved control of the flexible element, with a diminishing benefit as the time delay increased. Tracking error and subjective rating were significantly related. Some operators used a pulsive control strategy. CONCLUSION: Input shaping can improve the performance of a manually controlled system with flexibility, even when time delays are present. APPLICATION: This study is useful to designers of human-controlled systems, especially those with problematic flexibility and\/or time delays.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We propose a methodology for analyzing shared knowledge in engineering design teams. BACKGROUND: Whereas prior work has focused on shared knowledge in small teams at a specific point in time, the model presented here is both scalable and dynamic. METHOD: By quantifying team members' common views of design drivers, we build a network of shared mental models to reveal the structure of shared knowledge at a snapshot in time. Based on a structural comparison of networks at different points in time, a metric of change in shared knowledge is computed. RESULTS: Analysis of survey data from 12 conceptual space mission design sessions reveals a correlation between change in shared knowledge and each of several system attributes, including system development time, system mass, and technological maturity. CONCLUSION: From these results, we conclude that an early period of learning and consensus building could be beneficial to the design of engineered systems. APPLICATION: Although we do not examine team performance directly, we demonstrate that shared knowledge is related to the technical design and thus provide a foundation for improving design products by incorporating the knowledge and thoughts of the engineering design team into the process.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine reference physical performance values in older aging workers. BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional physical performance measures were collected for 736 manufacturing workers to assess effects of work and nonwork factors on age-related changes in musculoskeletal function and health. METHOD: Participants underwent surveys and physical testing that included bioelectrical impedance analysis, range-of-motion measures, exercise testing, and dynamic assessment. RESULTS: Physical characteristics, such as blood pressure and body fat percentage, were comparable to published values. Dynamic and range-of-motion measurements differed from published normative results. Women had age-related decreases in cervical extension and lateral rotation. Older men had better spinal flexion than expected. Predicted age-related decline in lower-extremity strength and shoulder strength in women was not seen. Men declined in handgrip, lower-extremity strength, and knee extension strength, but not trunk strength, across age groups. There was no appreciable decline in muscle fatigue at the trunk, shoulder, and knee with aging for either gender, except for the youngest age group of women. CONCLUSION: Normative values may underestimate physical performance in \"healthy\" older workers, thereby underappreciating declines in less healthy older workers. Work may be preservative of function for a large group of selected individuals. A \"healthy worker effect\" may be greater for musculoskeletal disease and function than for heart disease and mortality.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In a driving simulation, we investigated the efficacy of galvanic cutaneous stimulation (GCS) provided during curves or intermittently during the whole circuit to mitigate simulator syndrome (SS). BACKGROUND: The literature on how GCS decreases SS, although scarce, has demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique. Stimulation with this and similar techniques has usually been provided in curves or continuously during the whole circuit but never intermittently. This stimulation method could generate a continued activation of processes related to GCS mitigating SS. METHOD: Fifteen drivers (8 men; mean age = 25.5 years) participated in this experiment. We compared the total scores of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) across three stimulation conditions: (a) curve GCS condition, whereby GCS was provided in curves; (b) intermittent GCS condition, whereby GCS was provided intermittently during the whole circuit; and (c) no-stimulation condition, whereby no stimulation was provided (baseline condition). RESULTS: The experimental outcomes revealed that GCS decreased SS in both the curve and intermittent stimulation conditions. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that GCS is an effective countermeasure to decrease SS. It could be applied indifferently in curves or intermittently during the whole circuit. APPLICATION: For future interventions, we recommend the use of GCS to mitigate SS with similar intermittent stimulation programs. These programs have a crucial advantage as they are easily integrated into the simulator setup without the necessity of generating a complicated experimental design to stimulate during the curves.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were to identify factors affecting extension ladders' angular positioning and evaluate the effectiveness of two anthropometric positioning methods. BACKGROUND: A leading cause for extension ladder fall incidents is a slide-out event, usually related to suboptimal ladder inclination. An improved ladder positioning method or procedure could reduce the risk of ladder stability failure and the related fall injury. METHOD: Participants in the study were 20 experienced and 20 inexperienced ladder users. A series of ladder positioning tests was performed in a laboratory environment with 4.88-m (16-ft) and 7.32-m (24-ft) ladders in extended and retracted positions. The setup methods included a no-instruction condition and two anthropometric approaches: the American National Standards Institute A14 and \"fireman\" methods. Performance measures included positioning angle and time. RESULTS: The results indicated that ladder setup method and ladder effective length, defined by size and extended state, affected ladder positioning angle. On average, both anthropometric methods were effective in improving extension ladder positioning; however, they required 50% more time than did the no-instruction condition and had a 9.5% probability of setting the ladder at a less-than-70 degrees angle. Shorter ladders were consistently positioned at shallower angles. CONCLUSION: Anthropometric methods may lead to safer ladder positioning than does no instruction when accurately and correctly performed. Workers tended to underperform as compared with their theoretical anthropometric estimates. Specific training or use of an assistive device may be needed to improve ladder users' performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to advance an improved model of Flight Crew task performance. BACKGROUND: Existing task models present a \"local\" description of Flight Crew task performance. METHOD: Process mapping workshops, interviews, and observations were conducted with both pilots and flight operations personnel from five airlines, as part of the Human Integration into the Lifecycle of Aviation Systems (HILAS) project. RESULTS: The functional logic of the process dictates Flight Crew task requirements and specific task workflows. The Flight Crew task involves managing different levels of operational and environmental complexity, associated with the particular flight context. In so doing, the Flight Crew act as a coordinating interface between different human agents involved in the Active Flight Operations process and other processes that interface with this process. CONCLUSION: This article presents a new sociotechnical model of the Flight Crew task. The proposed model reflects a shift from a local explanation of Flight Crew task activity to a broader process-centric explanation. In so doing, it illuminates the complex role of procedures in commercial operations. APPLICATION: The task model suggests specific requirements for pilot task support tools, procedures design, performance evaluation and crew resource management (CRM) training. Also, this model might be used to assess future operational concepts and associated technology requirements. Lastly, this model provides the basis for the operational validation of both existing and future cockpit technologies.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative risk and efficiency of road crossing experienced by blind and sighted pedestrians at a single-lane roundabout with two levels of traffic volume and at two distances from the roundabout. BACKGROUND: With the rapid spread of modern roundabouts across the United States,their accessibility to blind pedestrians has become an important concern. To date, accessibility research relevant to blind pedestrians has focused on multilane roundabouts, and single-lane roundabouts have been virtually ignored. METHOD: Blind and sighted participants made judgments about when they would cross a single-lane roundabout with high and low traffic volumes, at exit and entry lanes, and at the actual crosswalks and at locations farther from the roundabout. RESULTS: Relative to sighted participants, blind participants' judgments about when to cross were more frequently risky, especially when traffic volume was high. Blind participants also were slower to make crossing judgments and accepted fewer crossing opportunities. Both groups made somewhat safer and more efficient judgments at locations farther from the roundabout. CONCLUSION: Some single-lane roundabouts may pose greater risk to blind pedestrians than to sighted pedestrians, especially when traffic volume is high. Crosswalk location merits further investigation as a design issue.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The current study examined human-human reliance during a computer-based scenario where participants interacted with a human aid and an automated tool simultaneously. BACKGROUND: Reliance on others is complex, and few studies have examined human-human reliance in the context of automation. Past research found that humans are biased in their perceived utility of automated tools such that they view them as more accurate than humans. Prior reviews have postulated differences in human-human versus human-machine reliance, yet few studies have examined such reliance when individuals are presented with divergent information from different sources. METHOD: Participants (N = 40) engaged in the Convoy Leader experiment.They selected a convoy route based on explicit guidance from a human aid and information from an automated map. Subjective and behavioral human-human reliance indices were assessed. Perceptions of risk were manipulated by creating three scenarios (low, moderate, and high) that varied in the amount of vulnerability (i.e., potential for attack) associated with the convoy routes. RESULTS: Results indicated that participants reduced their behavioral reliance on the human aid when faced with higher risk decisions (suggesting increased reliance on the automation); however, there were no reported differences in intentions to rely on the human aid relative to the automation. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that when individuals are provided information from both a human aid and automation,their reliance on the human aid decreased during high-risk decisions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Does adding situation awareness (SA) to a battery of cognitive tests improve prediction? BACKGROUND: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SA is often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms. METHOD: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (e.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitive tests (e.g., cognitive style, personality, demographics), we added measures of SA. RESULTS: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked off line, SA did not enter the model in two cases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third. CONCLUSION: Thus, some measures of SA do show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables. APPLICATION: On-line measures of SA can be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks.

{"abstract":"The patterns of life exhibited by large populations have been described and modeled both as a basic science exercise and for a range of applied goals such as reducing automotive congestion, improving disaster response, and even predicting the location of individuals. However, these studies have had limited access to conversation content, rendering changes in expression as a function of movement invisible. In addition, they typically use the communication between a mobile phone and its nearest antenna tower to infer position, limiting the spatial resolution of the data to the geographical region serviced by each cellphone tower. We use a collection of 37 million geolocated tweets to characterize the movement patterns of 180,000 individuals, taking advantage of several orders of magnitude of increased spatial accuracy relative to previous work. Employing the recently developed sentiment analysis instrument known as the hedonometer, we characterize changes in word usage as a function of movement, and find that expressed happiness increases logarithmically with distance from an individual's average location.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of Rockwell's early eye movements research. BACKGROUND: The advent of a new technology enabling measurements of eye movements in natural environments launched the seminal research of a Human Factors pioneer, Tom Rockwell, into how drivers process visual information. METHOD: In two seminal Human Factors articles -\"Mapping Eye-Movement Pattern to the Visual Scene in Driving: An Exploratory Study\"(Mourant&Rockwell, 1970) and\"Strategies of Visual Search by Novice and Experienced Drivers\"(Mourant&Rockwell, 1972)- Rockwell and his student, Ron Mourant, examined drivers' eye movements in naturalistic driving environments. RESULTS: The analyses of the visual fixations revealed systematic relationships between the sources of information the drivers needed to drive safely and the spatial distributions of their visual fixations. In addition, they showed that as drivers gain skill and experience, their pattern of fixations changes in a systematic manner. CONCLUSIONS: The research demonstrated that fixations and saccadic eye movements provide important insights into drivers' visual search behavior, information needs, and information acquisition processes. APPLICATION: This research has been a cornerstone for a myriad of driving-related studies, by Rockwell and other researchers. Building on Rockwell's pioneering work, these studies used eye-tracking systems to describe cognitive aspects of skill acquisition, and the effects of fatigue and other impairments on the process of attention and information gathering. A novel and potentially revolutionary application of this research is to use eye movement recordings for vehicle control and activation of in-vehicle safety systems.

{"abstract":"This study constructively extends Arthur et al. (2001) by assessing the convergence of self-report and archival motor vehicle crash involvement and moving violations data in a 2-year longitudinal follow-up. The relationships among these criteria, conscientiousness, and driving speed were also assessed using both predictive and postdictive criterion-related validation designs. Data were collected from a 2-year follow-up sample of 334 participants. Results suggested a lack of convergence between self-report and archival data at both Time 1 and Time 2. In addition, the predictor\/criterion relationships varied across research design and data source. An actual application of our findings is that the interpretation of relationships between specified predictors and crash involvement and moving violations must be made within the context of the criterion-related validation design and criterion data source. Specifically, predictive designs may produce results different from those of postdictive designs (which are more commonly used). Furthermore, self-report data appear to include a broader range of incidents (more crashes and tickets), and thus researchers should consider using self-report data when they are interested in including lower threshold crashes and tickets that may not be reported on state records (e.g., because of the completion of a defensive driving course).

BACKGROUND: Technical specifications and recommended practices for the design of visual warning systems emphasize the role of alert salience. Task demands and display context can modulate alert noticeability, however, meaning that salience alone does not guarantee attention capture. METHOD: A stochastic model integrated elements from existing models of visual attention to predict attentional behavior in dynamic environments.Validation studies tested the predictions of the new model against scanning data from a high-fidelity simulator study and behavioral data from an alert detection experiment.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To replicate a successful laboratory slip-class error paradigm and, more importantly, to further understand the underlying causes of errors made in that paradigm. BACKGROUND: Routine procedural errors are facts of everyday life but have received limited controlled empirical study, despite the sometimes severe consequences associated with such errors. This research concerns one such error, postcompletion error (M. D. Byrne&S. Bovair, 1997), which is a lapse that occurs after the main goal of a task has been satisfied. METHOD: In the two experiments conducted, participants were trained to criterion on a routine procedural task and were then brought back to the lab for a later session or sessions in which performance on task execution was measured. In the second experiment, a variety of motivational manipulations, retraining, and task redesign were compared. RESULTS: Experiment 1 demonstrated a substantial reduction of error rate generated by a simple design change (alteration of when feedback about goal completion occurred). Furthermore, the reduction in error rate came with no penalty in terms of overall speed of performance. Experiment 2 showed that this more appropriate design is superior to motivationally oriented interventions, retraining, and even midtask redesign. As in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 revealed no speed-accuracy tradeoff. CONCLUSION: These experiments provide evidence that controlled laboratory studies of slip-class errors can be meaningful and highlight the centrality of cognitive factors (particularly goal structure) in such errors.

BACKGROUND: There have been many studies on the impact of cell phone use on driving, showing some mixed findings. METHODS: Twenty-three studies (contributing 47 analysis entries) met the appropriate conditions for the meta-analysis. The statistical results from each of these studies were converted into effect sizes and combined in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, there were clear costs to driving performance when drivers were engaged in cell phone conversations. However, subsequent analyses indicated that these costs were borne primarily by reaction time tasks, with far smaller costs associated with tracking (lane-keeping) performance. Hands-free and handheld phones revealed similar patterns of results for both measures of performance. Conversation tasks tended to show greater costs than did information-processing tasks (e.g., word games). There was a similar pattern of results for passenger and remote (cell phone) conversations. Finally, there were some small differences between simulator and field studies, though both exhibited costs in performance for cell phone use. CONCLUSION: We suggest that (a) there are significant costs to driver reactions to external hazards or events associated with cell phone use, (b) hands-free cell phones do not eliminate or substantially reduce these costs, and (c) different research methodologies or performance measures may underestimate these costs. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the assessment of performance costs attributable to different types of cell phones, cell phone conversations, experimental measures, or methodologies.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to identify eye glance measures that are diagnostic of visual distraction. BACKGROUND: Visual distraction degrades performance, but real-time diagnostic measures have not been identified. METHOD: In a driving simulator, 14 participants responded to a lead vehicle braking at -2 or -2.7 m\/s2 periodically while reading a varying number of words (6-15 words every 13 s) on peripheral displays (with diagonal eccentricities of 24 degrees, 43 degrees, and 75 degrees). RESULTS: As the number of words and display eccentricity increased, total glance duration and reaction time increased and driving performance suffered. CONCLUSION: Correlation coefficients between several glance measures and reaction time or performance variables were reliably high, indicating that these glance measures are diagnostic of visual distraction. It is predicted that for every 25% increase in total glance duration, reaction time is increased by 0.39 s and standard deviation of lane position is increased by 0.06 m.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We explore whether the visual presentation of relative position vectors (RPVs) improves conflict detection in conditions representing some aspects of future airspace concepts. BACKGROUND: To help air traffic controllers manage increasing traffic, new tools and systems can automate more cognitively demanding processes, such as conflict detection. However, some studies reveal adverse effects of such tools, such as reduced situation awareness and increased workload. New displays are needed that help air traffic controllers handle increasing traffic loads. METHOD: A new display tool based on the display of RPVs, the Multi-Conflict Display (MCD), is evaluated in a series of simulated conflict detection tasks. The conflict detection performance of air traffic controllers with the MCD plus a conventional plan-view radar display is compared with their performance with a conventional plan-view radar display alone. RESULTS: Performance with the MCD plus radar was better than with radar alone in complex scenarios requiring controllers to find all actual or potential conflicts, especially when the number of aircraft on the screen was large. However performance with radar alone was better for static scenarios in which conflicts for a target aircraft, or target pair of aircraft, were the focus. CONCLUSION: Complementing the conventional plan-view display with an RPV display may help controllers detect conflicts more accurately with extremely high aircraft counts. APPLICATIONS: We provide an initial proof of concept that RPVs may be useful for supporting conflict detection in situations that are partially representative of conditions in which controllers will be working in the future.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We propose and test a method to reduce simulator sickness. BACKGROUND: Prolonged work in driving simulators often leads to nausea and other symptoms summarized as simulator sickness. Visual\/vestibular mismatches are a frequently addressed cause; we investigate another possibility, mismatch between actual distance to a screen and depicted distances in the simulator's graphics. METHOD: Drivers negotiated a figure-8 course in a photorealistic simulator. They reported discomfort and vection every 10 minutes up to 40 min. A correction group wore optometric test frames with + 1.75 diopter lenses and prisms to converge parallel lines of sight on a screen 56 cm from the driver's eyes, preserving the normal accommodative convergence-to-accommodation (AC\/A) ratio. A control group wore neutral lenses in the same test frames. In other experiments head tilt simulated vestibular experience on curves. RESULTS: The optical correction significantly reduced simulator sickness measured on a 10-point discomfort scale, where I is no problem and 10 is about to vomit. Vection ratings were similar for correction and control groups. Some drivers failed to complete the course because of high discomfort ratings, crashes, or other causes. Head tilt in the direction opposite each curve while wearing the correction did not affect discomfort, while tilt in the same direction as each curve made simulator sickness worse. CONCLUSION: Optical corrections can significantly reduce simulator sickness, though they do not eliminate it. Head tilt while driving is not recommended. Application: Simple optical corrections in spectacle frames, easily purchased at any optical facility, should be used in screen-based driving simulators. Strength of the correction depends on distance from the driver to the screen.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A study was run to test which of five electroencephalographic (EEG) indices was most diagnostic of loss of vigilance at two levels of workload. BACKGROUND: EEG indices of alertness include conventional spectral power measures as well as indices combining measures from multiple frequency bands, such as the Task Load Index (TLI) and the Engagement Index (El). However, it is unclear which indices are optimal for early detection of loss of vigilance. METHOD: Ninety-two participants were assigned to one of two experimental conditions, cued (lower workload) and uncued (higher workload), and then performed a 40-min visual vigilance task. Performance on this task is believed to be limited by attentional resource availability. EEG was recorded continuously. Performance, subjective state, and workload were also assessed. RESULTS: The task showed a vigilance decrement in performance; cuing improved performance and reduced subjective workload. Lower-frequency alpha (8 to 10.9 Hz) and TLI were most sensitive to the task parameters. The magnitude of temporal change was larger for lower-frequency alpha. Surprisingly, higher TLI was associated with superior performance. Frontal theta and El were influenced by task workload only in the final period of work. Correlational data also suggested that the indices are distinct from one another. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-frequency alpha appears to be the optimal index for monitoring vigilance on the task used here, but further work is needed to test how diagnosticity of EEG indices varies with task demands. APPLICATION: Lower-frequency alpha may be used to diagnose loss of operator alertness on tasks requiring vigilance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to understand the relationship between eye movements and cognitive workload in maintaining lane position while driving. BACKGROUND: Recent findings in driving research have found that, paradoxically, increases in cognitive workload decrease lateral position variability. If people drive where they look and drivers look more centrally with increased cognitive workload, then one could explain the decreases in lateral position variability as a result of changes in lateral eye movements. In contrast, it is also possible that cognitive workload brings about these patterns regardless of changes in eye movements. METHOD: We conducted three experiments involving a fixed-base driving simulator to independently manipulate eye movements and cognitive workload. RESULTS: Results indicated that eye movements played a modest role in lateral position variability, whereas cognitive workload played a much more substantial role. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in cognitive workload decrease lane position variability independently from eye movements. These findings are discussed in terms of hierarchical control theory.

Since outputs can be influenced by implementation differences, reliability assessment and standardization of implementation parameters are still an issue. The aim of this study is to assess the minimum number of required strides and the within-session reliability of 11 variability\/stability measures. METHOD: Ten healthy participants walked in a straight line at self-selected speed wearing two synchronized tri-axial Inertial Measurement Units. Five variability measures were calculated based on stride times namely Standard deviation, Coefficient of variation, Inconsistency of variance, Nonstationary index and Poincare plot. Six stability measures were calculated based on trunk accelerations namely Maximum Floquet multipliers, Short term\/long term Lyapunov exponents, Recurrence quantification analysis, Multiscale entropy, Harmonic ratio and Index of harmonicity. The required minimum number of strides and the within-session reliability for each measure were obtained based on the interquartile range\/mean ratio. Measures were classified in five categories (namely excellent, good, average, poor, and very poor) based on their reliability. RESULTS: The number of strides required to obtain a reliable measure was generally larger than those conventionally used. Variability measures showed average to poor reliability, while stability measures ranged from excellent to very poor reliability. CONCLUSION: Recurrence quantification analysis and multiscale entropy of trunk accelerations showed excellent reliability and a reasonable number of required strides. Based on these results, these measures should be taken into consideration in the assessment of fall risk. Language: en","authors":["F.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined motion sickness in an oscillating virtual environment presented via a video projector system. BACKGROUND: Visible oscillation of the physical environment is known to induce both postural instability and motion sickness, but it cannot be assumed that the same phenomena will occur in a virtual simulation of such motion. METHOD: Standing participants (3 men and 9 women, 20-22 years of age) were exposed to oscillation of a virtual room. The stimulus was a computer-generated simulation of a laboratory device that is known to induce postural instability and motion sickness. Participants viewed the simulation for up to 40 min and were instructed to discontinue if they experienced symptoms of motion sickness. RESULTS: Motion sickness incidence (42%) did not differ from that in studies using the corresponding physical moving room. Prior to motion sickness onset, the sick group exhibited changes in movement, relative to the well group, as predicted by the postural instability theory of motion sickness. Differences in movement between the sick and well groups developed over time, in contrast with previous studies using physical moving rooms, in which such movement differences have not evolved. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that changes in postural activity precede motion sickness that is induced by an oscillating virtual environment, but they also reveal differences in postural responses to virtual and physical motion environments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: I identify major theoretical and practical contributions to aging and human performance as reflected primarily in the pages of Human Factors. BACKGROUND: Populations worldwide are aging. True experimental work on aging is not possible because age levels cannot be manipulated. Sophisticated theoretical frameworks and modeling techniques are required to reach valid inferences about age effects and age changes. METHOD: Citation analysis was used to identify articles in Human Factors dealing with age or aging and to rank them for citation impact. RESULTS: Special issues on aging were followed by increased publication rates for articles on age or aging, particularly in the 1990s. Most-cited articles deal primarily with age and driving. CONCLUSIONS: Applied contributions rely on improved measurement of performance and on methodological advances, including simulation and modeling. Design changes that provide environmental support for declining cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor abilities can serve as a powerful intervention for maintaining and improving older adult performance. Training is also a robust way to improve performance at both the basic ability level and the level of task performance. Human factors specialists can improve quality of life for an aging population.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Experiments were conducted to assess the impact of display size on flight control, airspace surveillance, and goal-directed target search. BACKGROUND: Research of 3-D displays has shown that display scale compression influences the perception of flight path deviation, though less is known about the causes that drive this effect. In addition, research on attention-based tasks has shown that information displaced to significant eccentricities can amplify effort, but it is unclear whether the effect generates a performance difference in complex displays. METHOD: In Experiment 1, 16 pilots completed a low-fidelity flight control task under single- and dual-axis control. In Experiment 2, the control task from Experiment 1 was scaled up to a more realistic flight environment, and pilots performed hazard surveillance and target search tasks. RESULTS: For flight control, pilots exhibited less path error and greater stick activity with a large display, which was attributed both to greater enhanced resolution and to the fact that larger depictions of error lead to greater urgency in correcting deviations. Size did not affect hazard surveillance or search, as pilots were adaptive in altering scanning patterns in response to the enlargement of the displays.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of knowledge of results (KR) on vigilance accuracy and report the first use of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP) to assess vigilance training effectiveness. BACKGROUND: Training individuals to detect infrequent signals among a plethora of nonsignals is critical to success in many failure-intolerant monitoring technologies. KR has been widely used for vigilance training, but the effect of the schedule of KR presentation on accuracy has been neglected. Previous research on training for vigilance has used signal detection metrics or hits and false alarms. In this study diagnosticity measures were applied to augment traditional analytic methods. METHOD: We examined the effects of continuous KR and a partial-KR regimen versus a no-KR control on decision diagnosticity. RESULTS: Signal detection theory (SDT) analysis indicated that KR induced conservatism in responding but did not enhance sensitivity. However, KR in both forms equally enhanced PPP while selectively impairing NPP. CONCLUSION: There is a trade-off in the effectiveness of KR in reducing false alarms and misses. Together, SDT and PPP\/NPP measures provide a more complete portrait of performance effects. APPLICATION: PPP and NPP together provide another assessment technique for vigilance performance, and as additional diagnostic tools, these measures are potentially useful to the human factors community.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A study was run to test the sensitivity of multiple workload indices to the differing cognitive demands of four military monitoring task scenarios and to investigate relationships between indices. BACKGROUND: Various psychophysiological indices of mental workload exhibit sensitivity to task factors. However, the psychometric properties of multiple indices, including the extent to which they intercorrelate, have not been adequately investigated. METHOD: One hundred fifty participants performed in four task scenarios based on a simulation of unmanned ground vehicle operation. Scenarios required threat detection and\/or change detection. Both single- and dual-task scenarios were used. Workload metrics for each scenario were derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram, transcranial Doppler sonography, functional near infrared, and eye tracking. Subjective workload was also assessed. RESULTS: Several metrics showed sensitivity to the differing demands of the four scenarios. Eye fixation duration and the Task Load Index metric derived from EEG were diagnostic of single-versus dual-task performance. Several other metrics differentiated the two single tasks but were less effective in differentiating single- from dual-task performance. Psychometric analyses confirmed the reliability of individual metrics but failed to identify any general workload factor. An analysis of difference scores between low- and high-workload conditions suggested an effort factor defined by heart rate variability and frontal cortex oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: General workload is not well defined psychometrically, although various individual metrics may satisfy conventional criteria for workload assessment. APPLICATION: Practitioners should exercise caution in using multiple metrics that may not correspond well, especially at the level of the individual operator.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This work introduced judgment-based measures of spatial awareness and used them to evaluate terrain textures and fields of view (FOVs) in synthetic vision system (SVS) displays. BACKGROUND: SVSs are cockpit technologies that depict computer-generated views of terrain surrounding an aircraft. In the assessment of textures and FOVs for SVSs, no studies have directly measured the three levels of spatial awareness with respect to terrain: identification of terrain, its relative spatial location, and its relative temporal location. METHODS: Eighteen pilots made four judgments (relative azimuth angle, distance, height, and abeam time) regarding the location of terrain points displayed in 112 noninteractive 5-s simulations of an SVS head-down display. There were two between-subject variables (texture order and FOV order) and five within-subject variables (texture, FOV, and the terrain point's relative azimuth angle, distance, and height). RESULTS: Texture produced significant main and interaction effects for the magnitude of error in the relative angle, distance, height, and abeam time judgments. FOV interaction effects were significant for the directional magnitude of error in the relative distance, height, and abeam time judgments. CONCLUSION: Spatial awareness was best facilitated by the elevation fishnet (EF), photo fishnet (PF), and photo elevation fishnet (PEF) textures. APPLICATION: This study supports the recommendation that the EF, PF, and PEF textures be further evaluated in future SVS experiments. Additionally, the judgment-based spatial awareness measures used in this experiment could be used to evaluate other display parameters and depth cues in SVSs. Language: en","authors":["Matthew L.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to present and expand on current theories and measurement techniques for assessing team workload. BACKGROUND: To date, little research has been conducted on the workload experienced by teams. A validated theory describing team workload, which includes an account of its relation to individual workload, has not been articulated. METHOD: The authors review several theoretical approaches to team workload.Within the team research literature, attempts to evaluate team workload have typically relied on measures of individual workload. This assumes that such measures retain their validity at the team level of measurement, but empirical research suggests that this method may lack sensitivity to the drivers of team workload. RESULTS: On the basis of these reviews, the authors advance suggestions concerning a comprehensive theory of team workload and methods for assessing it in team settings. The approaches reviewed include subjective, performance, physiological, and strategy shift measures. Theoretical and statistical difficulties associated with aggregating individual-level workload responses to a team-level measure are discussed. CONCLUSION: Conception and measurement of team workload have not significantly matured alongside developments in individual workload. APPLICATION: Team workload remains a complex research area without simple measurement solutions, but as a research domain it remains open for contributions from interested and enterprising researchers.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A high-fidelity street crossing simulator was used to test the hypothesis that experienced action video game players are less vulnerable than non-gamers to dual task costs in complex tasks. BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that action video game players outperform nonplayers on many single task measures of perception and attention. It is unclear, however, whether action video game players outperform nonplayers in complex, divided attention tasks. METHOD: Experienced action video game players and nongamers completed a street crossing task in a high-fidelity simulator. Participants walked on a manual treadmill to cross the street. During some crossings, a cognitively demanding working memory task was added. RESULTS: Dividing attention resulted in more collisions and increased decision making time. Of importance, these dual task costs were equivalent for the action video game players and the nongamers. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that action video game players are equally susceptible to the costs of dividing attention in a complex task.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The strategies of novice and expert crime scene examiners were compared in searching crime scenes. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that experts frame a scene through reconstructing the likely actions of a criminal and use contextual cues to develop hypotheses that guide subsequent search for evidence. METHOD: Novice (first-year undergraduate students of forensic sciences) and expert (experienced crime scene examiners) examined two \"simulated\" crime scenes. Performance was captured through a combination of concurrent verbal protocol and own-point recording, using head-mounted cameras. RESULTS: Although both groups paid attention to the likely modus operandi of the perpetrator (in terms of possible actions taken), the novices paid more attention to individual objects, whereas the experts paid more attention to objects with \"evidential value.\" Novices explore the scene in terms of the objects that it contains, whereas experts consider the evidence analysis that can be performed as a consequence of the examination. CONCLUSION: The suggestion is that the novices are putting effort into detailing the scene in terms of its features, whereas the experts are putting effort into the likely actions that can be performed as a consequence of the examination.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the nauseogenic properties of commercial console video games (i.e., games that are sold to the public) when presented through a head-mounted display. BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports suggest that motion sickness may occur among players of contemporary commercial console video games. METHODS: Participants played standard console video games using an Xbox game system. We varied the participants' posture (standing vs. sitting) and the game (two Xbox games). Participants played for up to 50 min and were asked to discontinue if they experienced any symptoms of motion sickness. RESULTS: Sickness occurred in all conditions, but it was more common during standing. During seated play there were significant differences in head motion between sick and well participants before the onset of motion sickness. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that commercial console video game systems can induce motion sickness when presented via a head-mounted display and support the hypothesis that motion sickness is preceded by instability in the control of seated posture.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The nature of increased-age-related dual-task interference was examined during a driving-like dual task in the laboratory. BACKGROUND: Previous research revealed age-related deficits in dual tasks especially when cognitive and motor demands are involved. The specific contributions of sensory input, working memory demands, and\/or coordination of motor responses to dual-task interference are not clear and should be clarified in the present study. METHOD: Younger and older participants performed a driving-like tracking task and a visually cued attention task within a dual task. Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded during task performance. RESULTS: Overall tracking performance was lower for the older versus younger participants. This age-related decline was particularly pronounced in the time interval after the stimulus when the attention task demanded a motor response. In contrast, older participants tracked relatively better than the younger participants in the time interval preceding the stimulus. In the attention task, the older versus younger participants showed increased responses times and rates of false alarms and misses, suggesting a deficit in retaining the context in the cue-stimulus interval. The electroencephalogram data suggest that the older participants invested more resources than the younger participants in dual-task management during the cue-stimulus interval. CONCLUSION: Evidence was found for increased motor interference and a deficient context processing as well as for an increased investment of processing resources in the older compared with the younger group. APPLICATION: The results suggest that in-vehicle information systems for older drivers should be designed to support cue maintenance and that simultaneous motor demands should not be required.

{"abstract":"Three studies explored amateur and professional users' compliance with pesticide warning labels. Professionals were classified as people working in a profession in which the use of pesticides is a necessary part of their job. Amateurs used pesticides only in their leisure time. The first study showed that the wording used affected perception of the appropriateness of hazard statements, one of the most effective variations being the use of the personal pronoun (statements beginning \"You should...\"). The location of warning information was also found to affect actual compliance: Compliance increased when warning information was presented in the directions for use section. A supplemental directive increased compliance only for professional users. In a final study, \"best-case\" and \"worst-case\" linguistic variations were combined with best-case and worst-case locations for safety information. Instruction statements using the personal pronoun and presented in the directions for use section resulted in the highest levels of compliance. The differences in compliance between amateur and professional users are interpreted within the framework of Rasmussen's (1986) distinction among skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model capable of predicting variability in the mental workload experienced by frontline operators under routine and nonroutine conditions. BACKGROUND: Excess workload is a risk that needs to be managed in safety-critical industries. Predictive models are needed to manage this risk effectively yet are difficult to develop. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that workload prediction is a multilevel problem. METHOD: A multilevel workload model was developed in Study I with data collected from an en route air traffic management center. Dynamic density metrics were used to predict variability in workload within and between work units while controlling for variability among raters.The model was cross-validated in Studies 2 and 3 with the use of a high-fidelity simulator. RESULTS: Reported workload generally remained within the bounds of the 90% prediction interval in Studies 2 and 3. Workload crossed the upper bound of the prediction interval only under nonroutine conditions. Qualitative analyses suggest that nonroutine events caused workload to cross the upper bound of the prediction interval because the controllers could not manage their workload strategically. CONCLUSION: The model performed well under both routine and nonroutine conditions and over different patterns of workload variation. APPLICATION: Workload prediction models can be used to support both strategic and tactical workload management. Strategic uses include the analysis of historical and projected workflows and the assessment of staffing needs.Tactical uses include the dynamic reallocation of resources to meet changes in demand.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated how automation-induced human performance consequences depended on the degree of automation (DOA). BACKGROUND: Function allocation between human and automation can be represented in terms of the stages and levels taxonomy proposed by Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens. Higher DOAs are achieved both by later stages and higher levels within stages. METHOD: A meta-analysis based on data of 18 experiments examines the mediating effects of DOA on routine system performance, performance when the automation fails, workload, and situation awareness (SA). The effects of DOA on these measures are summarized by level of statistical significance. RESULTS: We found (a) a clear automation benefit for routine system performance with increasing DOA, (b) a similar but weaker pattern for workload when automation functioned properly, and (c) a negative impact of higher DOA on failure system performance and SA. Most interesting was the finding that negative consequences of automation seem to be most likely when DOA moved across a critical boundary, which was identified between automation supporting information analysis and automation supporting action selection. CONCLUSION: Results support the proposed cost-benefit trade-off with regard to DOA. It seems that routine performance and workload on one hand, and the potential loss of SA and manual skills on the other hand, directly trade off and that appropriate function allocation can serve only one of the two aspects. APPLICATION: Findings contribute to the body of research on adequate function allocation by providing an overall picture through quantitatively combining data from a variety of studies across varying domains.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of active stereoscopic simulation-based training and individual differences in video game experience on multiple indices of combat identification (CID) performance. BACKGROUND: Fratricide is a major problem in combat operations involving military vehicles. In this research, we aimed to evaluate the effects of training on CID performance in order to reduce fratricide errors. METHOD: Individuals were trained on 12 combat vehicles in a simulation, which were presented via either a non-stereoscopic or active stereoscopic display using NVIDIA's GeForce shutter glass technology. Self-report was used to assess video game experience, leading to four between-subjects groups: high video game experience with stereoscopy, low video game experience with stereoscopy, high video game experience without stereoscopy, and low video game experience without stereoscopy. We then tested participants on their memory of each vehicle's alliance and name across multiple measures, including photographs and videos. RESULTS: There was a main effect for both video game experience and stereoscopy across many of the dependent measures. Further, we found interactions between video game experience and stereoscopic training, such that those individuals with high video game experience in the non-stereoscopic group had the highest performance outcomes in the sample on multiple dependent measures. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that individual differences in video game experience may be predictive of enhanced performance in CID tasks. APPLICATION: Selection based on video game experience in CID tasks may be a useful strategy for future military training. Future research should investigate the generalizability of these effects, such as identification through unmanned vehicle sensors. Language: en","authors":["Joseph R.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We report on four experiments that investigated the critical tracking task's (CTT) potential as a tool to measure distraction. BACKGROUND: Assessment of the potential of new in-vehicle information systems to be distracting has become an important issue. An easy-to-use method, which might be a candidate to assess this distraction, is the CTT. The CTT requires an operator to stabilize a bar, which is displayed on a computer screen, such that it does not depart from a predefined target position. As the CTT reflects various basic aspects of the operational level of the driving task, we used it as a simple surrogate for driving to assess the CTT's capabilities. METHOD: We employed secondary tasks of varying demand, artificial tasks as well as tasks representative of secondary tasks while driving, and asked participants to perform them together with the CTT in parallel. CTT performance, secondary task performance, and subjective ratings of load were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, the CTT was able to differentiate between different levels of demand elicited by the secondary tasks. The results obtained corresponded with our a priori assumptions about the respective secondary tasks' potential to distract. CONCLUSION: It appears that the CTT can be used to assess in-vehicle information systems with regard to their potential to distract drivers. Additional experiments are necessary to further clarify the relationship between driving and CTT performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The current study is intended to evaluate the stability of a scissor lift and the performance of various fall-arrest harnesses\/lanyards during drop\/fall-arrest conditions and to quantify the dynamic loading to the head\/ neck caused by fall-arrest forces. BACKGROUND: No data exist that establish the efficacy of fall-arrest systems for use on scissor lifts or the injury potential from the fall incidents using a fall-arrest system. METHOD: The authors developed a multibody dynamic model of the scissor lift and a human lift operator model using ADAMS and LifeMOD Biomechanics Human Modeler. They evaluated lift stability for four fall-arrest system products and quantified biomechanical impacts on operators during drop\/fall arrest, using manikin drop tests. Test conditions were constrained to flat surfaces to isolate the effect of manikin-lanyard interaction. RESULTS: The fully extended scissor lift maintained structural and dynamic stability for all manikin drop test conditions. The maximum arrest forces from the harnesses\/lanyards were all within the limits of ANSI Z359.1. The dynamic loading in the lower neck during the fall impact reached a level that is typically observed in automobile crash tests, indicating a potential injury risk for vulnerable participants. CONCLUSION: Fall-arrest systems may function as an effective mechanism for fall injury protection for operators of scissor lifts. However, operators may be subjected to significant biomechanical loadings on the lower neck during fall impact. APPLICATION: Results suggest that scissor lifts retain stability under test conditions approximating human falls from predefined distances but injury could occur to vulnerable body structures.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to demonstrate analysis methods that are sensitive to speed-related differences between experienced and young novice drivers. These differences may be linked to determining which group is better at anticipating hazards. BACKGROUND: Awareness of hazardous situations, especially potential ones, is a major discriminator between experienced and young novice drivers who tend to misidentify potential hazards in the traffic environment. METHOD: Experienced and young novice drivers were asked to drive a sequence of 14 scenarios in a driving simulator. Scenarios were created in two city areas, residential and business district, and included various types of hazards. Group homogeneity of speed for each group of drivers was computed for each scenario, and two business district scenarios were subjected to piecewise linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Group homogeneity analysis showed consistent and significant experience-based differences across all scenarios, revealing that the experienced drivers as a group were more homogenous in choosing their driving speed. Differences between groups were larger in the business district where speed was less restricted. Piecewise linear regression analysis revealed that experienced drivers approached uncontrolled intersections by slowing down and responded earlier to materialized events. CONCLUSION: Young novice drivers were more likely than experienced drivers to choose diverse values of speed at any given road section, presumably due to their poor awareness of potential and hidden hazards. Unlike other analysis methods, it is argued that group homogeneity of speed is a more sensitive measurement to reveal these gaps. APPLICATION: Speed management could be the basis of future hazard anticipation simulator assessments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether concurrent bandwidth feedback improves learning of the lane-keeping task in a driving simulator. BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that bandwidth feedback improves learning and that off-target feedback is superior to on-target feedback. This study aimed to extend these findings for the lane-keeping task. METHOD: Participants without a driver's license drove five 8-min lane-keeping sessions in a driver training simulator: three practice sessions, an immediate retention session, and a delayed retention session I day later. There were four experimental groups (n=15 per group): (a) on-target, receiving seat vibrations when the center of the car was within 0.5 m of the lane center; (b) off-target, receiving seat vibrations when the center of the car was more than 0.5 m away from the lane center; (c) control, receiving no vibrations; and (d) realistic, receiving seat vibrations depending on engine speed. During retention, all groups were provided with the realistic vibrations. RESULTS: During practice, on-target and off-target groups had better lane-keeping performance than the nonaugmented groups, but this difference diminished in the retention phase. Furthermore, during late practice and retention, the off-target group outperformed the on-target group.The off-target group had a higher rate of steering reversal and higher steering entropy than the nonaugmented groups, whereas no clear group differences were found regarding mean speed, mental workload, or self-reported measures.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Four experiments were conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of dynamic vibrotactile collision-warning signals in potentially enhancing safe driving. BACKGROUND: Auditory neuroscience research has demonstrated that auditory signals that move toward a person are more salient than those that move away. If this looming effect were found to extend to the tactile modality, then it could be utilized in the context of in-car warning signal design. METHOD: The effectiveness of various vibrotactile warning signals was assessed using a simulated car-following task. The vibrotactile warning signals consisted of dynamic toward-\/away-from-torso cues (Experiment 1), dynamic versus static vibrotactile cues (Experiment 2), looming-intensity- and constant-intensity-toward-torso cues (Experiment 3), and static cues presented on the hands or on the waist, having either a low or high vibration intensity (Experiment 4). RESULTS: Braking reaction times (BRTs) were significantly faster for toward-torso as compared to away-from-torso cues (Experiments 1 and 2) and static cues (Experiment 2). This difference could not have been attributed to differential responses to signals delivered to different body parts (i.e., the waist vs. hands; Experiment 4). Embedding a looming-intensity signal into the toward-torso signal did not result in any additional BRT benefits (Experiment 3). CONCLUSION: Dynamic vibrotactile cues that feel as though they are approaching the torso can be used to communicate information concerning external events, resulting in a significantly faster reaction time to potential collisions. APPLICATION: Dynamic vibrotactile warning signals that move toward the body offer great potential for the design of future in-car collision-warning system.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of airline pilot training for abnormal in-flight events. BACKGROUND: Numerous accident reports describe situations in which pilots responded to abnormal events in ways that were different from what they had practiced many times before. One explanation for these missteps is that training and testing for these skills have become a highly predictable routine for pilots who arrive to the training environment well aware of what to expect. Under these circumstances, pilots get plentiful practice in responding to abnormal events but may get little practice in recognizing them and deciding which responses to offer. METHOD: We presented 18 airline pilots with three abnormal events that are required during periodic training and testing. Pilots were presented with each event under the familiar circumstances used during training and also under less predictable circumstances as they might occur during flight. RESULTS: When presented in the routine ways seen during training, pilots gave appropriate responses and showed little variability. However, when the abnormal events were presented unexpectedly, pilots' responses were less appropriate and showed great variability from pilot to pilot. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the training and testing practices used in airline training may result in rote-memorized skills that are specific to the training situation and that offer modest generalizability to other situations. We recommend a more complete treatment of abnormal events that allows pilots to practice recognizing the event and choosing and recalling the appropriate response. APPLICATION: The results will aid the improvement of existing airline training practices. Language: en","authors":["Stephen M. Casner","Richard W. Geven","Kent T.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this laboratory experiment was to demonstrate how taking a longitudinal, multilevel approach can be used to examine the dynamic relationship between subjective workload and performance over a given period of activity involving shifts in task demand. BACKGROUND: Subjective workload and conditions of the performance environment are oftentimes examined via cross-sectional designs without distinguishing within-from between-person effects. Given the dynamic nature of performance phenomena, multilevel designs coupled with manipulations of task demand shifts are needed to better model the dynamic relationships between state and trait components of subjective workload and performance. METHOD: With a sample of 75 college students and a computer game representing a complex decision-making environment, increases and decreases in task demand were counterbalanced and subjective workload and performance were measured concurrently in regular intervals within performance episodes. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: Both between- and especially within-person effects were dynamic. Nevertheless, at both levels of analysis, higher subjective workload reflected performance problems, especially more downstream from increases in task demand. CONCLUSION: As a function of cognitive-energetic processes, shifts in task demand are associated with changes in how subjective workload is related to performance over a given period of activity. Multilevel, longitudinal approaches are useful for distinguishing and examining the dynamic relationships between state and trait components of subjective workload and performance. APPLICATION: The findings of this research help to improve the understanding of how a sequence of demands can exceed a performer's capability to respond to further demands.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research was designed to examine the impact of heuristic-based approaches to the acquisition of task-related information on the selection of an optimal alternative during simulated in-flight decision making. BACKGROUND: The work integrated features of naturalistic and normative decision making and strategies of information acquisition within a computer-based, decision support framework. METHOD: The study comprised two phases, the first of which involved familiarizing pilots with three different heuristic-based strategies of information acquisition: frequency, elimination by aspects, and majority of confirming decisions. The second stage enabled participants to choose one of the three strategies of information acquisition to resolve a fourth (choice) scenario. RESULTS: The results indicated that task-oriented experience, rather than the information acquisition strategies, predicted the selection of the optimal alternative. It was also evident that of the three strategies available, the elimination by aspects information acquisition strategy was preferred by most participants. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that task-oriented experience, rather than the process of information acquisition, predicted task accuracy during the decision-making task. It was also concluded that pilots have a preference for one particular approach to information acquisition.

BACKGROUND: Up-to-date anthropometric information of the U.S. truck driver population is needed for the design of safe and ergonomically efficient truck cabs. METHOD: We collected 35 anthropometric dimensions for 1,950 truck drivers (1,779 males and 171 females) across the continental United States using a sampling plan designed to capture the appropriate ethnic, gender, and age distributions of the truck driver population. RESULTS: Truck drivers are heavier than the U.S.general population, with a difference in mean body weight of 13.5 kg for males and 15.4 kg for females. They are also different in physique from the U.S. general population. In addition, the current truck drivers are heavier and different in physique compared to their counterparts of 25 to 30 years ago. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study provide more accurate anthropometric information for cab designs than do the current U.S. general population data or truck driver data collected 25 to 30 years ago. Multivariate anthropometric models, spanning 95% of the current truck driver population on the basis of a set of 12 anthropometric measurements, have been developed to facilitate future cab designs.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine whether prospective memory error and response costs to ongoing tasks in an air traffic control simulation could be reduced by providing spatial context. BACKGROUND: Prospective memory refers to remembering to perform an intended action at an appropriate point in the future. Failures of prospective memory can occur in air traffic control. METHOD: For this study, three conditions of participants performed an air traffic control task that required them to accept and hand off aircraft and to prevent conflicts. The prospective memory task required participants to remember to press an alternative key rather than the routine key when accepting target aircraft. A red line separated the display into upper and lower regions. Participants in the context condition were told that the prospective memory instruction would apply only to aircraft approaching from one region (upper or lower). Those in the standard condition were not provided this information. In the control condition, participants did not have to perform the prospective memory task. RESULTS: In the context condition, participants made fewer prospective memory errors than did those in the standard condition and made faster acceptance decisions for aircraft approaching from irrelevant compared with relevant regions. Costs to hand-off decision time were also reduced in the context condition. Spatial context provided no benefit to conflict detection. CONCLUSION: Participants could partially localize their allocation of attentional resources to the prospective memory task to relevant display regions.

{"abstract":"Two experiments were conducted to determine if age affects comprehension for explicit and implied warning information and, if so, to reveal the nature of such effects. Experiment 1 measured younger (18-23 years) and older (65-75 years) adults' comprehension for real-world warnings via a verification test presented immediately after reading the warnings or after a delay. In Experiment 2, younger (18-22 years) and older (64-76 years) participants also read fabricated warnings that were inconsistent with real-world knowledge. In both experiments, older adults frequently failed to infer the correct hazard and safety information. The older adults also had trouble understanding warning information even when it was explicitly stated (when no inferences were required), especially when memory demands were high and product-specific knowledge could not be used. That many of the older adults did not understand commonly used product warnings indicates that the wording on many household products is not conducive to being understood by everyone who uses them. Actual or potential applications of this research include the recommendation that designers of product labels, warnings, and instructions should consider minimizing memory load and maximizing opportunities for knowledge application when designing consumer warnings.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This article presented four anthropometric theories (univariate, bivariate\/probability distribution, multivariate, and shape-based methods) for protective equipment design decisions. BACKGROUND: While the significance of anthropometric information for product design is well recognized, designers continue to face challenges in selecting efficient anthropometric data processing methods and translating the acquired information into effective product designs. METHODS: For this study, 100 farm tractor operators, 3,718 respirator users, 951 firefighters, and 816 civilian workers participated in four studies on the design of tractor roll-over protective structures (ROPS), respirator test panels, fire truck cabs, and fall-arrest harnesses, respectively. Their anthropometry and participant-equipment interfaces were evaluated. RESULTS: Study I showed a need to extend the 90-cm vertical clearance for tractor ROPS in the current industrial standards to 98.3 to 101.3 cm. Study 2 indicated that current respirator test panel would have excluded 10% of the male firefighter population; a systematic adjustment to the boundaries of test panel cells was suggested. Study 3 provided 24 principal component analysis-based firefighter body models to facilitate fire truck cab design. Study 4 developed an improved gender-based fall-arrest harness sizing scheme to supplant the current unisex system. CONCLUSIONS: This article presented four anthropometric approaches and a six-step design paradigm for ROPS, respirator test panel, fire truck cab, and fall-arrest harness applications, which demonstrated anthropometric theories and practices for defining protective equipment fit and sizing schemes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study determined the most favorable strategy for carrying scaffold end frames while minimizing the risk of injuries from being struck by an object, falling, and overexertion. BACKGROUND: Scaffold erectors are at risk of high exposure to the aforementioned hazards associated with the dynamic human-scaffolding interface and work environments. Identifying an optimal work strategy can help reduce risk of injuries to the worker. METHOD: Three carrying methods, four types of work surfaces, two weights of scaffold frames, and three directions of stepping movement were tested in a laboratory with 18 construction workers. RESULTS: The effects of carrying method on postural instability and task difficulty rating were significant for handling the 22-kg end frame. Response time, postural instability, and perceived task difficulty rating were significantly reduced when the 9-kg end frame was used as compared with the 22-kg frame. CONCLUSION: The symmetric side-carrying method was the best option for handling 22-kg scaffold end frames. A 9-kg end frame (e.g., made of reinforced lightweight materials) has the potential to reduce injury risk among scaffold handlers during their scaffold erection and dismantlingjobs.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the literature on display clutter by reviewing definitions and measurement techniques and to develop a comprehensive, ergonomics-oriented perspective on clutter. We provide guidance for the selection of measurement approaches that can capture the various aspects and effects of clutter on visual search in particular. BACKGROUND: There is agreement that clutter may represent a significant problem to operators. The challenge is to determine the ideal middle ground between excessive data and insufficient information. However, definitions of clutter vary widely, which explains the range of measurement approaches, including image-processing algorithms, performance evaluation, subjective evaluation, and eye tracking. It is important to understand the affordances of each technique and provide guidance for their use. METHOD: We provide a systematic review of clutter definitions and develop a performance-oriented perspective for ergonomics research. Next, we present a critical overview of clutter measurement approaches. The benefits and limitations of each technique are detailed, and recommendations for best practice are provided. RESULTS: From an ergonomics perspective, clutter matters to the extent that it affects performance, particularly, visual search. A combination of measurement techniques can be employed in order to assess the performance costs stemming from the multiple aspects of clutter. CONCLUSION: Display clutter is a multifaceted construct that is a problem when it results in performance and attentional costs. The assessment of these costs is critical and requires the use of appropriate and complementary techniques.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated how the order in which information is presented affects when a person decides to stop performing a task. BACKGROUND: A stopping decision is a decision to stop performing a task on the basis of a sequence of cues. Previous order-effects models do not account for how these contexts limit available working memory for making such decisions. METHOD: Participants decided how long to perform a task known as the Work Hazard Game that began by rewarding points but later cost points if work continued after an unannounced \"emergency.\" An additive sequence of cues indicated the probability of an emergency. Study I involved a three-group design with cue sequences that indicated the same risk at each decision point but whose final cue presented a high, medium, or low probability. Study 2 had a 2 x 2 design with high or low final cues and an easy or a challenging task. RESULTS: In Study I, participants stopped sooner when the most recent cue presented a high rather than low probability (p = .09), despite the same emergency risk. In Study 2, participants stopped sooner when the most recent cue presented a high rather than low probability for the challenging task but not for the easy task (p = .08). CONCLUSION: Stopping decisions appear sensitive to the most recent cue observed while experiencing task load. Participants responded to the same risks differently only on the basis of a change in presentation.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current work was to clarify how subjective trust determines response behavior when interacting with a signaling system. BACKGROUND: In multiple theoretical frameworks, trust is acknowledged as a prime mediator between system error characteristics and automation dependence. Some researchers have operationally defined trust as the behavior exhibited. Other researchers have suggested that although trust may guide operator responses, trust does not completely determine the behavior. METHOD: Forty-four participants interacted with a primary flight simulation task and a secondary signaling system task. The signaling system varied in reliability (90%, 60%) and error bias (false alarm, miss prone). Trust was measured halfway through the experimental session to address the criterion of temporal precedence in determining the effect of trust on behavior. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that trust partially mediated the relationship between reliability and agreement rate. Trust did not mediate the relationship between reliability and reaction time. Trust also did not mediate the relationships between error bias and reaction time or agreement rate. Analyses of variance generally supported specific behavioral and trust hypotheses, indicating that the paradigm employed produced similar effects on response behaviors and subjective estimates of trust observed in other studies. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that strong assumptions of trust acting as the prime mediator between system error characteristics and response behaviors should be viewed with caution.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research evaluated the training effectiveness of a novel simulation interface, a wearable computer integrated into a soldier's load-bearing equipment. BACKGROUND: Military teams often use game-based simulators on desktop computers to train squad-level procedures. A wearable computer interface that mimics the soldier's equipment was expected to provide better training through increased realism and immersion. METHOD: A heuristic usability evaluation and two experiments were conducted. Eight evaluators interacted with both wearable and desktop interfaces and completed a usability survey. The first experiment compared the training retention of the wearable interface with a desktop simulator and interactive training video. The second experiment compared the training transfer of the wearable and desktop simulators with a live training environment. RESULTS: Results indicated the wearable interface was more difficult to use and elicited stronger symptoms of simulator sickness. There was no significant difference in training retention between the wearable, desktop, or interactive video training methods. The live training used in the second experiment provided superior training transfer than the simulator conditions, with no difference between the desktop and wearable. CONCLUSION: The wearable simulator interface did not provide better training than the desktop computer interface. It also had poorer usability and caused worse simulator sickness. Therefore, it was a less effective training tool. APPLICATION: This research illustrates the importance of conducting empirical evaluations of novel training technologies.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of a specific post-license driver training program on postural stability and vehicle kinematics during cornering. BACKGROUND: Inertial forces experienced during driving can perturb a driver's posture, which may in turn diminish a driver's perceptual sensitivity and corresponding control actions. METHODS: A trainee group (n=21) and control group (n=12) participated in the study. The trainee group participated in a 2-day driver training program that included instruction on how to enhance perceptual sensitivity, postural stability, and vehicle kinematics during common driving maneuvers, including cornering. Postural stability and vehicle kinematics were assessed during cornering maneuvers performed on a closed-circuit track using an instrumented vehicle prior to and following training. RESULTS: Trainee drivers experienced enhanced postural stability and reduced the magnitude and onset of peak vehicle lateral accelerations following training. Prior to training, drivers who were more posturally unstable tended to experience higher lateral vehicle accelerations, and drivers with the biggest improvements in postural stability following training tended to experience the greatest reductions in lateral accelerations of the vehicle. CONCLUSION: Training led to changes in postural stability that were associated with reduced lateral accelerations during cornering. APPLICATION: The reduction in lateral accelerations following training in the present study indicates a greater dynamic margin of safety for cornering. Overall findings suggest that the driver training programs produced beneficial effects on cornering kinematics and that these effectswere associated with enhanced postural stability.

{"abstract":"Despite patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were reported of revealing gait disorders and balance problems, there is still lack of objective quantitative measurement of gait patterns and balance capability of AD patients. Based on an inertial-sensor-based wearable device, this paper develops gait and balance analyzing algorithms to obtain quantitative measurements and explores the essential indicators from the measurements for AD diagnosis. The gait analyzing algorithm is composed of stride detection followed by gait cycle decomposition so that gait parameters are developed from the decomposed gait details. On the other hand, the balance is measured by the sway speed in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions of the projection path of body's center of mass (COM). These devised gait and balance parameters were explored on twenty-one AD patients and fifty healthy controls (HCs). Special evaluation procedure including single-task and dual-task walking experiments for observing the cognitive function and attention is also devised for the comparison of AD and HC groups. Experimental results show that the wearable instrument with the designed gait and balance analyzing system is a promising tool for automatically analyzing gait information and balance ability, serving as assistant indicators for early diagnosis of AD.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study measured the effectiveness of a parking sensor system, a rearview camera, and a sensor system combined with a camera for preventing a collision with a stationary or moving child-size object in the path of a backing vehicle. BACKGROUND: An estimated 15,000 people are injured and 210 are killed every year in backover crashes involving light vehicles. Cameras and sensor systems may help prevent these crashes. METHOD: The sample included 111 drivers (55 men, 56 women), including 16 in the no-technology condition, 32 in the sensor condition, 32 in the camera condition, and 31 in the camera-plus-sensor condition. A stationary or moving child-size object was surreptitiously deployed in the path of participants backing out of a parking stall. RESULTS: A significantly smaller proportion of participants in the camera condition hit the stationary object compared with participants in the no-technology condition; however, this benefit was greatly reduced when the stationary object was partially or completely in the shade. Significantly fewer participants hit the moving object than the stationary object. The percentage of participants in the sensor, camera, and camera-plus-sensor conditions who hit the moving object was not different from the no-technology condition. CONCLUSION: The camera was the only technology that was effective for preventing collisions with the stationary object. The variation in collision outcomes between the stationary- and moving-object conditions illustrates how the effectiveness of these technologies is dependent on the backing situation.

{"abstract":"Pedestrians dramatically overestimate their own visibility at night. This is likely to result in pedestrians unknowingly engaging in dangerous behavior. To determine the extent to which pedestrians' estimates of their own visibility are influenced by educational interventions, clothing reflectance, and headlamp beam setting, participants in 2 experiments estimated their own nighttime visibility by walking toward a stationary car to the point where they believed they were just recognizable as a pedestrian. In the first experiment 48 university students were tested and in the second experiment 9 high-school driver education students were tested. Overall, participants failed to appreciate the benefits of reflective clothing and of high-beam illumination. However, the participants in Experiment 1 who had heard a relevant lecture several weeks earlier gave estimates that were 10% shorter than did a control group. Participants in Experiment 2 heard a more focused and graphic-intensive lecture and gave estimates that were 56% shorter than did a control group. Potential applications of this research include increasing pedestrian safety by designing and implementing research-based public education campaigns aimed at reducing pedestrians' overestimates of their own nighttime visibility.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments examined the detectability of multiple transient changes within a cluttered and dynamic display (a simulated sonar display). BACKGROUND: Research suggests that there are severe limitations when multiple targets must be detected within close temporal proximity. The present research explored whether these limitations influence performance in a dynamic monitoring task. METHOD: Participants monitored a cluttered and dynamic display and reported the number of new objects that appeared (one to four objects). The time between onset events was varied. A blinking cue sometimes accompanied each new object, giving observers multiple opportunities to detect it. RESULTS: A large decrease in performance was observed when participants were asked to detect multiple targets within a short period of time. Performance was worse than predicted based on the attention literature. Performance suffered when observers were asked to detect more than two or three targets. The blinking cue greatly attenuated this performance deficit, even for short-duration blinking cues (one blink). CONCLUSION: Operators can easily become overwhelmed when asked to respond to even a small number of events when these events occur close in time. Extending transient events in time improves performance, but some attentional limitations may be difficult or impossible to overcome. APPLICATION: These results have important implications for systems in which important events may occur within close temporal proximity (e.g., when a sonar operator is tasked with detecting threats in the battle space).

{"abstract":"Accurate processing of nonvisual stimuli is fundamental to humans with visual impairments. In this population, moving sounds activate an occipito-temporal region thought to encompass the equivalent of monkey area MT+, but it remains unclear whether the signal carries information beyond the mere presence of motion. To address this important question, we tested whether the processing in this region retains functional properties that are critical for accurate motion processing and that are well established in the visual modality. Specifically, we focussed on the property of 'directional selectivity', because MT+ neurons in non-human primates fire preferentially to specific directions of visual motion. Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed similar properties in sighted humans by successfully decoding different directions of visual motion from fMRI activation patterns. Here we used fMRI and multivariate pattern classification to demonstrate that the direction in which a sound is moving can be reliably decoded from dorsal occipito-temporal activation in the blind. We also show that classification performance is at chance (i) in a control region in posterior parietal cortex and (ii) when motion information is removed and subjects only hear a sequence of static sounds presented at the same start and end positions. These findings reveal that information about the direction of auditory motion is present in dorsal occipito-temporal responses of blind humans. As such, this area, which appears consistent with the hMT+ complex in the sighted, provides crucial information for the generation of a veridical percept of moving non-visual stimuli.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study applies text mining to extract clusters of vehicle problems and associated trends from free-response data in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's vehicle owner's complaint database. BACKGROUND: As the automotive industry adopts new technologies, it is important to systematically assess the effect of these changes on traffic safety. Driving simulators, naturalistic driving data, and crash databases all contribute to a better understanding of how drivers respond to changing vehicle technology, but other approaches, such as automated analysis of incident reports, are needed. METHOD: Free-response data from incidents representing two severity levels (fatal incidents and incidents involving injury) were analyzed using a text mining approach: latent semantic analysis (LSA). LSA and hierarchical clustering identified clusters of complaints for each severity level, which were compared and analyzed across time. RESULTS: Cluster analysis identified eight clusters of fatal incidents and six clusters of incidents involving injury. Comparisons showed that although the airbag clusters across the two severity levels have the same most frequent terms, the circumstances around the incidents differ. The time trends show clear increases in complaints surrounding the Ford\/Firestone tire recall and the Toyota unintended acceleration recall. Increases in complaints may be partially driven by these recall announcements and the associated media attention. CONCLUSION: Text mining can reveal useful information from free-response databases that would otherwise be prohibitively time-consuming and difficult to summarize manually. APPLICATION: Text mining can extend human analysis capabilities for large free-response databases to support earlier detection of problems and more timely safety interventions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the frequency response of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) for oscillating linear motion in the fore-and-aft axis. BACKGROUND: Simulators, virtual environments, and commercially available video games that create an illusion of self-motion are often reported to induce the symptoms seen in response to true motion. Often this human response can be the limiting factor in the acceptability and usability of such systems. Whereas motion sickness in physically moving environments is known to peak at an oscillation frequency around 0.2 Hz, it has recently been suggested that VIMS peaks at around 0.06 Hz following the proposal that the summed response of the visual and vestibular self-motion systems is maximized at this frequency. METHODS: We exposed 24 participants to random dot optical flow patterns simulating oscillating fore-and-aft motion within the frequency range of 0.025 to 1.6 Hz. Before and after each 20-min exposure, VIMS was assessed with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Also, a standard motion sickness scale was used to rate symptoms at 1-min intervals during each trial. RESULTS: VIMS peaked between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz with a reducing effect at lower and higher frequencies. CONCLUSION: The numerical prediction of the \"crossover frequency\" hypothesis, and the design guidance curve previously proposed, cannot be accepted when the symptoms are purely visually induced. APPLICATION: In conditions in which stationary observers are exposed to optical flow that simulates oscillating fore-and-aft motion, frequencies around 0.2 to 0.4 Hz should be avoided.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a new index of perceived mental workload, the Multiple Resource Questionnaire (MRQ), with the standard measure of workload used in the study of vigilance, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). BACKGROUND: The NASA-TLX has been used extensively to demonstrate that vigilance tasks impose a high level of workload on observers. However, this instrument does not specify the information-processing resources needed for task performance. The MRQ offers a tool to measure the workload associated with vigilance assignments in which such resources can be identified. METHOD: Two experiments were performed in which factors known to influence task demand were varied. Included were the detection of stimulus presence or absence, detecting critical signals by means of successive-type (absolute judgment) and simultaneous-type (comparative judgment) discriminations, and operating under multitask vs. single-task conditions. RESULTS: The MRQ paralleled the NASA-TLX in showing that vigilance tasks generally induce high levels of workload and that workload scores are greater in detecting stimulus absence than presence and in making successive as compared to simultaneous-type discriminations. Additionally, the MRQ was more effective than the NASA-TLX in reflecting higher workload in the context of multitask than in single-task conditions. The resource profiles obtained with MRQ fit well with the nature of the vigilance tasks employed, testifying to the scale's content validity. CONCLUSION: The MRQ may be a meaningful addition to the NASA-TLX for measuring the workload of vigilance assignments.

{"abstract":"The far-anchor effect is responsible for a motion-in-depth illusion that has only recently been recognized. When viewing conditions are limited, motions in depth of a farther target in a two-object display may readily be perceived as opposite motions in depth of the nearer target. The present studies determined whether this error could be avoided through controlled fixation or training with feedback. Under conditions of reduced visibility, participants (college students) viewed 64 two-target presentations varying in the position of the moving target and its direction of motion. Neither fixation instructions nor informational feedback about motion errors affected the occurrence of the basic illusion, nor did a vertical separation of the targets eliminate the main effect, indicating the robustness of the motion illusion under some relatively realistic variations. Such errors in judging motion in depth have significance for both midair collisions between aircraft and ground-incursion accidents under conditions of reduced visibility. Potential applications include the elaboration of examples used in pilot training programs or in training programs for ground personnel. Language: en","authors":["Karen R. Young","Donald H.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This paper describes an experiment directed toward refinement and initial field testing of two potential countermeasures for the problem of rear-end (RE) crashes. The countermeasures consist of \"imminent warning\" signals intended to direct the following driver's visual glance to the lead vehicle as it brakes rapidly to a stop and for a short time thereafter. BACKGROUND: RE crashes are the most frequently occurring type of light vehicle crash, making up at least 25% of all crashes. METHOD: A preliminary experiment was conducted to facilitate improvement of the attention-getting capability of an alternating pair of lamps. In the main experiment, an oscillating narrow beam lamp (a promising candidate from a previous experiment) and an improved alternating pair (improved as compared with that in a previous experiment) were compared with ordinary rear lighting. Seventy-two drivers were purposely distracted by in-vehicle tasks as the lead (surrogate) vehicle braked hard. RESULTS: Results showed improvements of 0.25 to 0.35 s in brake activation times for the two enhanced configurations as compared with ordinary rear lighting.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the implementation of an adaptive driver support system. BACKGROUND: Providing support might not always be desirable from a safety perspective, as support may lead to problems related to a human operator being out of the loop. In contrast, adaptive support systems are designed to keep the operator in the loop as much as possible by providing support only when necessary. METHOD: A total of 31 experienced drivers were exposed to three modes of lane-keeping support nonadaptive, adaptive, and no support. Support involved continuously updated lateral position feedback shown on a head-up display. When adaptive, support was triggered by performance-based indications of effort investment. Narrowing lane width and increasing density of oncoming traffic served to increase steering demand, and speed was fixed in all conditions to prevent any compensatory speed reactions. RESULTS: Participants preferred the adaptive support mode mainly as a warning signal and tended to ignore nonadaptive feedback. Furthermore, driving behavior was improved by adaptive support in that participants drove more centrally, displayed less lateral variation and drove less outside the lane's delineation when support was in the adaptive mode compared with both the no-support mode and the nonadaptive support mode. CONCLUSION: A human operator is likely to use machine-triggered adaptations as an indication that thresholds have been passed, regardless of the support that is initiated. Therefore supporting only the sensory processing stage of the human information processing system with adaptive automation may not feasible.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We show that psychophysiologically driven real-time adaptive aiding significantly enhances performance in a complex aviation task. A further goal was to assess the importance of individual operator capabilities when providing adaptive aiding. BACKGROUND: Psychophysiological measures are useful for monitoring cognitive workload in laboratory and real-world settings. They can be recorded without intruding into task performance and can be analyzed in real time, making them candidates for providing operator functional state estimates. These estimates could be used to determine if and when system intervention should be provided to assist the operator to improve system performance. METHODS: Adaptive automation was implemented while operators performed an uninhabited aerial vehicle task. Psychophysiological data were collected and an artificial neural network was used to detect periods of high and low mental workload in real time. The high-difficulty task levels used to initiate the adaptive automation were determined separately for each operator, and a group-derived mean difficulty level was also used. RESULTS: Psychophysiologically determined aiding significantly improved performance when compared with the no-aiding conditions. Improvement was greater when adaptive aiding was provided based on individualized criteria rather than on group-derived criteria. The improvements were significantly greater than when the aiding was randomly provided. CONCLUSION: These results show that psychophysiologically determined operator functional state assessment in real time led to performance improvement when included in closed loop adaptive automation with a complex task.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This article evaluates the effectiveness of two interventions: a self-leveling pallet carousel designed to position the loads vertically and horizontally at origin, and an adjustable cart designed to raise loads vertically at destination to reduce spine loads. BACKGROUND: Low back disorders among workers in manual material handling industries are very prevalent and have been linked to manual palletizing operations. Evidence into the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions is limited, with no research that investigates interventions with adjustable load location. METHOD: Thirteen males experienced in manual material handling participated in simulated order selecting tasks where spine loads were quantified for each intervention condition: carousel to traditional cart, pallet to traditional cart, pallet to adjustable cart, and carousel to adjustable cart. RESULTS: The results showed that combining both devices results in reduction in spine compression (61%), anterior-posterior shear (72%), and lateral shear (63%) compared to traditional palletizing conditions. Individually, the carousel was responsible for the greatest reductions, but the lowest values were typically achieved by combining the adjustable cart and carousel. CONCLUSION: The combination of the interventions (self-leveling carousel and adjustable cart) was most effective in reducing the spine loads when compared to the traditional pallet-cart condition. The individual interventions also reduced the loads compared to the traditional condition.

{"abstract":"Focusing on a specific crowd dynamics situation, including real life experiments and measurements, our paper targets a twofold aim: (1) we present a Bayesian probabilistic method to estimate the value and the uncertainty (in the form of a probability density function) of parameters in crowd dynamic models from the experimental data; and (2) we introduce a fitness measure for the models to classify a couple of model structures (forces) according to their fitness to the experimental data, preparing the stage for a more general model-selection and validation strategy inspired by probabilistic data analysis. Finally, we review the essential aspects of our experimental setup and measurement technique.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to build upon the state of knowledge about the impacts of sleep disruption into the domain of complex cognitive task performance for three types of sleep disruption: total sleep deprivation, sleep restriction, and circadian cycle. BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption affects human performance by increasing the likelihood of errors or the time it takes to complete tasks, such as the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. It is not clear whether complex tasks are affected in the same way. Understanding the impact of sleep disruption on complex cognitive tasks is important for, and in some instances more relevant to, professional workers confronted with unexpected, catastrophic failures following a period of disrupted sleep. METHOD: Meta-analytic review methods were applied to each of the three different areas of sleep disruption research. RESULTS: Complex cognitive task performance declines over consecutive hours of continuous wakefulness as well as consecutive days of restricted sleep, is worse for severely restricted sleep (4 or fewer hours in bed), is worse during the circadian nadir than apex, and appears less degraded than simple task performance. CONCLUSION: The reviews suggest that complex cognitive task performance may not be impacted by disrupted sleep as severely as simple cognitive task performance. APPLICATION: Findings apply to predicting effects of sleep disruption on workers in safety-critical environments, such as health care, aviation, the military, process control, and in particular, safety-critical environments involving shiftwork or long-duration missions.

{"abstract":"Before taking a decision, a driver anticipates the future behavior of other traffic participants. However, if a driver is inattentive or overloaded, he may fail to consider relevant information. This can lead to bad decisions and potentially result in an accident. A computational system that is designed to anticipate other traffic participants' behaviors could assist the driver in his decision making by sending him an early warning when a risk of collision is predicted. Existing research in this area usually focuses on only one of two aspects, i.e., quality or scope. Quality refers to the ability to warn a driver early before a dangerous situation happens. Scope is the diversity of scenarios in which the approach can work. In general, we see methods targeting a broad scope but showing low quality, with others having a narrow scope but high quality. Our goal is to create a system with high quality and high scope. To achieve this, we propose an architecture that combines classifiers to predict behaviors for many scenarios. In this paper, we will first introduce the generic concept of such a system applicable to highway and inner-city scenarios. We will show that a combination of general and specific classifiers is a solution to improve quality and scope based on a concrete implementation for lane-change prediction in highway scenarios. 2014 IEEE.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if interruptions affect the quality of work. BACKGROUND: Interruptions are commonplace at home and in the office. Previous research in this area has traditionally involved time and errors as the primary measures of disruption. Little is known about the effect interruptions have on quality of work. METHOD: Fifty-four students outlined and wrote three essays using a within-subjects design. During Condition 1, interruptions occurred while participants were outlining. During Condition 2, interruptions occurred while they were writing. No interruptions occurred in Condition 3. RESULTS: Quality of work was significantly reduced in both interruption conditions when compared to the non-interruption condition. The number of words produced was significantly reduced when participants were interrupted while writing the essay but not when outlining the essay. CONCLUSION: This research represents a crucial first step in understanding the effect interruptions have on quality of work. Our research suggests that interruptions negatively impact quality of work during a complex, creative writing task. Since interruptions are such a prevalent part of daily life, more research needs to be conducted to determine what other tasks are negatively impacted. Moreover, the underlying mechanism(s) causing these decrements needs to be identified. Finally, strategies and systems need to be designed and put in place to help counteract the decline in quality of work caused by interruptions. Language: en","authors":["Cyrus K. Foroughi","Nicole E.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effectiveness of error-encouragement training and the influence of ability and personality attribute-treatment interactions using a dynamic decision-making task. BACKGROUND: Error-encouragement training is said to be more effective than error-avoidance training because active exploration and error encouragement promote better learning and transfer. Past research, which is limited by confounded experimental designs involving simple tasks with little consideration of individual differences, provides evidence for the value of active exploration but less so for error encouragement METHOD: We randomly allocated 164 participants to receive error-encouragement, error-avoidance, or no error-related instructions in training on ATC-lab, a dynamic computer simulated air traffic control task. Active exploration and task information were controlled, and ability and personality were assessed. RESULTS: Error encouragement yielded better transfer performance than did error avoidance but was no better than the control training. Higher- rather than lower-ability trainees benefited from training with an error orientation (positive or negative), suggesting that learning from errors in training requires greater cognitive resources. Trainees higher in openness to experience and agreeableness performed more poorly with error-avoidance training than with error-encouragement and control training. CONCLUSION: Error-avoidance training had a detrimental effect especially for those less open to experience, lower in agreeableness, and of lower ability. The significant benefits of error-encouragement training reported in previous research were probably attributable to confounding factors, such as active exploration and differential task information. APPLICATION: Although errors and active exploration can be useful learning tools in training, trainers should be mindful that focusing on errors, whether positively or negatively, may not suit everyone.

{"abstract":"We develop an agent-based model of utilitarian walking and use the model to explore spatial and socio-economic factors affecting adult utilitarian walking and how travel costs as well as various educational interventions aimed at changing attitudes can alter the prevalence of walking and income differentials in walking. The model is validated against US national data. We contrast realistic and extreme parameter values in our model and test effects of changing these parameters across various segregation and pricing scenarios while allowing for interactions between travel choice and place and for behavioral feedbacks. RESULTS suggest that in addition to income differences in the perceived cost of time, the concentration of mixed land use (differential density of residences and businesses) are important determinants of income differences in walking (high income walk less), whereas safety from crime and income segregation on their own do not have large influences on income differences in walking. We also show the difficulty in altering walking behaviors for higher income groups who are insensitive to price and how adding to the cost of driving could increase the income differential in walking particularly in the context of segregation by income and land use. We show that strategies to decrease positive attitudes towards driving can interact synergistically with shifting cost structures to favor walking in increasing the percent of walking trips. Agent-based models, with their ability to capture dynamic processes and incorporate empirical data, are powerful tools to explore the influence on health behavior from multiple factors and test policy interventions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how a consideration of glance sequences to in-vehicle tasks and their associated distributions can be informative. BACKGROUND: The rapid growth in the number of nomadic technologies and in-vehicle devices has the potential to create complex, visually intensive tasks for drivers that may incur long in-vehicle glances. Such glances place drivers at increased risk of a motor vehicle crash. METHOD: We used eye-glance data from a study of distraction training programs to examine the change in glance duration distributions across consecutive glances during the performance of various in-vehicle tasks. RESULTS: The sequential analysis across trained and untrained drivers showed that the proportion of late-sequence glances longer than a 2-s threshold among untrained drivers was almost double the number of such glances for the trained drivers, that the third and later glances were particularly problematic, and that training reduced the proportion of early- and later-sequence glances. CONCLUSION: Examining how the duration of off-road glances varies as a function of their order in a sequence of glances and the visual demands of the task can offer important insights into the change in the distracting potential of in-vehicle tasks across glances and the effects of training.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether performance effects of cross-modal spatial links that were observed in earlier laboratory studies scale to more complex environments and need to be considered in multimodal interface design. It also revisits the unresolved issue of cross-modal cuing asymmetries. BACKGROUND: Previous laboratory studies employing simple cues, tasks, and\/or targets have demonstrated that the efficiency of processing visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli is affected by the modality, lateralization, and timing of surrounding cues. Very few studies have investigated these cross-modal constraints in the context of more complex environments to determine whether they scale and how complexity affects the nature of cross-modal cuing asymmetries. METHOD: Amicroworld simulation of battlefield operations with a complex task set and meaningful visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli was used to investigate cuing effects for all cross-modal pairings. RESULTS: Significant asymmetric performance effects of cross-modal spatial links were observed. Auditory cues shortened response latencies for collocated visual targets but visual cues did not do the same for collocated auditory targets. Responses to contralateral (rather than ipsilateral) targets were faster for tactually cued auditory targets and each visual-tactile cue-target combination, suggesting an inhibition-of-return effect. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial relationships between multimodal cues and targets significantly affect target response times in complex environments. The performance effects of cross-modal links and the observed cross-modal cuing asymmetries need to be examined in more detail and considered in future interface design. APPLICATION: The findings from this study have implications for the design of multimodal and adaptive interfaces and for supporting attention management in complex, data-rich domains.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated how drivers adapt secondary-task initiation and time-sharing behavior when faced with fluctuating driving demands. BACKGROUND: Reading text while driving is particularly detrimental; however, in real-world driving, drivers actively decide when to perform the task. METHOD: In a test track experiment, participants were free to decide when to read messages while driving along a straight road consisting of an area with increased driving demands (demand zone) followed by an area with low demands. A message was made available shortly before the vehicle entered the demand zone. We manipulated the type of driving demands (baseline, narrow lane, pace clock, combined), message format (no message, paragraph, parsed), and the distance from the demand zone when the message was available (near, far). RESULTS: In all conditions, drivers started reading messages (drivers' first glance to the display) before entering or before leaving the demand zone but tended to wait longer when faced with increased driving demands. While reading messages, drivers looked more or less off road, depending on types of driving demands. CONCLUSIONS: For task initiation, drivers avoid transitions from low to high demands; however, they are not discouraged when driving demands are already elevated. Drivers adjust time-sharing behavior according to driving demands while performing secondary tasks. Nonetheless, such adjustment may be less effective when total demands are high.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare continuous versus bandwidth haptic steering guidance in terms of lane-keeping behavior, aftereffects, and satisfaction. BACKGROUND: An important human factors question is whether operators should be supported continuously or only when tolerance limits are exceeded. We aimed to clarify this issue for haptic steering guidance by investigating costs and benefits of both approaches in a driving simulator. METHODS: Thirty-two participants drove five trials, each with a different level of haptic support: no guidance (Manual); guidance outside a 0.5-m bandwidth (Band1); a hysteresis version of Band1, which guided back to the lane center once triggered (Band2); continuous guidance (Cont); and Cont with double feedback gain (ContS). Participants performed a reaction time task while driving. Toward the end of each trial, the guidance was unexpectedly disabled to investigate aftereffects. RESULTS: All four guidance systems prevented large lateral errors (>0.7 m). Cont and especially ContS yielded smaller lateral errors and higher time to line crossing than Manual, Band1, and Band2. Cont and ContS yielded short-lasting aftereffects, whereas Band1 and Band2 did not. Cont yielded higher self-reported satisfaction and faster reaction times than Band1. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and bandwidth guidance both prevent large driver errors. Continuous guidance yields improved performance and satisfaction over bandwidth guidance at the cost of aftereffects and variability in driver torque (indicating human-automation conflicts). APPLICATION: The presented results are useful for designers of haptic guidance systems and support critical thinking about the costs and benefits of automation support systems.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effectiveness of collaborative training for individuals with low pretraining self-efficacy versus individuals with high pretraining self-efficacy regarding the acquisition of a complex skill that involved strong cognitive and psychomotor demands. BACKGROUND: Despite support for collaborative learning from the educational literature and the similarities between collaborative learning and interventions designed to remediate low self-efficacy, no research has addressed how self-efficacy and collaborative learning interact in contexts concerning complex skills and human-machine interactions. METHOD: One hundred fifty-five young male adults trained either individually or collaboratively with a more experienced partner on a complex computer task that simulated the demands of a dynamic aviation environment. Participants also completed a task-specific measure of self-efficacy before, during, and after training. RESULTS: Collaborative training enhanced skill acquisition significantly more for individuals with low pretraining self-efficacy than for individuals with high pretraining self-efficacy. However, collaborative training did not bring the skill acquisition levels of those persons with low pretraining self-efficacy to the levels found for persons with high pretraining self-efficacy. Moreover, tests of mediation suggested that collaborative training may have enhanced appropriate skill development strategies without actually raising self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Although collaborative training can facilitate the skill acquisition process for trainees with low self-efficacy, future research is needed that examines how the negative effects of low pretraining self-efficacy on complex skill acquisition can be more fully remediated.

However, few existing computational models are able to simulate human performance and mental workload at the same time. We propose a new computational modeling approach--a queuing network approach based on queuing network theory of human performance (Liu, 1996, 1997) and neuroscience discoveries. This modeling approach is composed of a simulation model of a queuing network architecture and a set of mathematical equations implemented in the simulation model to quantify mental workload. It not only successfully models the mental workload measured by the six workload scales in NASA-TLX in terms of subnetwork utilization, but also simulates driving performance, reflecting mental workload from both subjective and performance-based measurements. In addition, this modeling approach allows us to visualize mental workload in driving in real-time. Further usage and implementation of the model in designing intelligent and adaptive in-vehicle systems are discussed.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sensitivity of visual attention and driving performance for detecting changes in driver cognitive workload across different age groups. BACKGROUND: The literature shows mixed results concerning the sensitivity of gaze concentration metrics to variations in cognitive demand. No studies appear showing how age affects gaze allocation during cognitive demand. METHOD: Recordings of drivers' gaze and driving performance by individuals in their 20s, 40s, and 60s were captured in actual driving conditions during three levels of cognitive demand. RESULTS: Gaze concentration increased with task difficulty through the low and moderate levels of demand and then appeared to level out at the high demand level. At the moderate difficulty level, gaze concentration increased by 2.4 cm (approximately 2 degrees) from the reference period. The degree of gaze concentration with added cognitive demand is not related to age in the relatively healthy drivers studied. Driving performance measures did not show a consistent relationship with the objective demand level. CONCLUSION: Gaze concentration appears at low levels of cognitive demand prior to the appearance of marked decrements in driving control. There is no compelling evidence from this study that driving performance measures can be used to index differences in workload prior to capacity saturation. APPLICATION: Drivers' awareness of vehicle surroundings is incrementally affected by increases in cognitive demand. Developers of more advanced driver support systems should consider gaze concentration as a measure of driver cognitive workload. This recommendation is particularly relevant in light of the added benefits of gaze measurements for detecting visual demand.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the effectiveness of blue force tracking (BFT) decision support for dismounted infantry soldiers. BACKGROUND: Technologies to support combat identification (CID) are rapidly evolving and may be deployable to dismounted soldiers in the future. BFT systems are designed to mitigate the risk of fratricide by supplying positional information regarding friendly units to enhance situation awareness. METHOD: Participants played the role of a dismounted infantry soldier in a first-person perspective gaming environment and made engagement decisions for a series of simulated targets, half of which were enemies and half of which were friends. RESULTS: Participants performed better overall when they were able to use a BFT system than when they performed the task without assistance. When a 10-s latency was added to the updating of position information in the BFT, participants made significantly more false alarms (engaged a friendly target) regardless of whether they knew about the latency. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the promise of a personal BFT device to reduce the likelihood of fratricide by dismounted infantry soldiers. The results, however, also indicate that the effectiveness of such a device can be dramatically reduced when it does not provide real-time data.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether distortions occur in motion extrapolation of car-following scenes in younger and older drivers. BACKGROUND: Drivers cannot see an entire traffic scene clearly with one glance. They must extrapolate the motion of surrounding vehicles while scanning other parts of the scene. Further, abilities relevant to motion extrapolation decline with age. Thus, it is important to evaluate age differences in motion extrapolation. METHOD: Displays simulated car-following scenes. After an interruption, the scene reappeared at the correct position in its trajectory or at a position that was more advanced or less advanced than the correct position. Drivers reported whether the scene reappeared at the correct position. RESULTS: When the virtual self moved faster than the lead car, older drivers' judgments were biased toward less advanced reappearance positions. Younger drivers' judgments were biased toward more advanced positions. The implication is that older drivers extrapolated the motion slower than did younger drivers. CONCLUSION: Distortions occurred in motion extrapolation of car-following scenes, and age differences occurred in such distortions. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include traffic safety.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined how individuals, younger and older, interacted with an imperfect automated system. The impact of workload on performance and automation use was also investigated. BACKGROUND: Automation is used in situations characterized by varying levels of workload. As automated systems spread to domains such as transportation and the home, a diverse population of users will interact with automation. Research is needed to understand how different segments of the population use automation. METHOD: Workload was systematically manipulated to create three levels (low, moderate, high) in a dual-task scenario in which participants interacted with a 70% reliable automated aid. Two experiments were conducted to assess automation use for younger and older adults. RESULTS: Both younger and older adults relied on the automation more than they complied with it. Among younger adults, high workload led to poorer performance and higher compliance, even when that compliance was detrimental. Older adults' performance was negatively affected by workload, but their compliance and reliance were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Younger and older adults were both able to use and double-check an imperfect automated system. Workload affected how younger adults complied with automation, particularly with regard to detecting automation false alarms. Older adults tended to comply and rely at fairly high rates overall, and this did not change with increased workload. APPLICATION: Training programs for imperfect automated systems should vary workload and provide feedback about error types, and strategies for identifying errors. The ability to identify automation errors varies across individuals, thereby necessitating training. Language: en","authors":["Sara E. McBride","Wendy A. Rogers","Arthur D.

{"abstract":"Containing the spread of crime in urban societies remains a major challenge. Empirical evidence suggests that, if left unchecked, crimes may be recurrent and proliferate. On the other hand, eradicating a culture of crime may be difficult, especially under extreme social circumstances that impair the creation of a shared sense of social responsibility. Although our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the emergence and diffusion of crime is still incomplete, recent research highlights applied mathematics and methods of statistical physics as valuable theoretical resources that may help us better understand criminal activity. We review different approaches aimed at modeling and improving our understanding of crime, focusing on the nucleation of crime hotspots using partial differential equations, self-exciting point process and agent-based modeling, adversarial evolutionary games, and the network science behind the formation of gangs and large-scale organized crime. We emphasize that statistical physics of crime can relevantly inform the design of successful crime prevention strategies, as well as improve the accuracy of expectations about how different policing interventions should impact malicious human activity that deviates from social norms. We also outline possible directions for future research, related to the effects of social and coevolving networks and to the hierarchical growth of criminal structures due to self-organization.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined prospectively the effect of workplace violence on musculoskeletal symptoms among nursing home workers. BACKGROUND: Previously we reported a cross-sectional relationship between physical assaults at work and musculoskeletal pain. This follow-up provides stronger evidence of the effect of workplace violence on musculoskeletal outcomes within the same workforce over two years. METHOD: Nursing home workers who responded to three consecutive annual surveys formed the study cohort (n = 344). The outcomes were any musculoskeletal pain, widespread pain, pain intensity, pain interference with work and sleep, and co-occurring pain with depression. The main predictor was self-reported physical assault at work during the 3 months preceding each survey. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were assessed with log-binomial regression, adjusting for other workplace and individual factors. RESULTS: Every fourth nursing home worker, and 34% of nursing aides, reported persistent workplace assault over the 2 years. Among respondents assaulted frequently, two thirds experienced moderate to extreme musculoskeletal pain, and more than 50% had pain interfering with work and\/or sleep. Baseline exposure to assault predicted pain outcomes 1 year later. Repeated exposure was associated with a linear increase over 2 years in the risks of pain intensity, interference with work, and interference with sleep; co-occurring pain and depression had an adjusted PR of 3.6 (95% CI = 1.7-7.9). CONCLUSION: Workplace assault, especially when repeated over time, increases the risk of pain that may jeopardize workers' ability to remain employed. APPLICATION: More effective assault prevention would protect and support the workforce needed to care for our increasing elderly and disabled population.

{"abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Ambient intelligence technologies are a means to support ageing-in-place by monitoring clients in the home. In this study, monitoring is applied for the purpose of raising an alarm in an emergency situation, and thereby, providing an increased sense of safety and security. Apart from these technological solutions, there are numerous environmental interventions in the home environment that can support people to age-in-place. The aim of this study was to investigate the needs and motives, related to ageing-in-place, of the respondents receiving ambient intelligence technologies, and to investigate whether, and how, these technologies contributed to aspects of ageing-in-place. METHODOLOGY: This paper presents the results of a qualitative study comprised of interviews and observations of technology and environmental interventions in the home environment among 18 community-dwelling older adults with a complex demand for care. These respondents had a prototype of the Unattended Autonomous Surveillance system, an example of ambient intelligence technology, installed in their homes as a means to age-in-place. The UAS-system offers a large range of functionalities, including mobility monitoring, voice response, fire detection, as well as wandering detection and prevention, which can be installed in different configurations. RESULTS: The respondents had various motives to use ambient intelligence technologies to support ageing-in-place. The most prominent reason was to improve the sense of safety and security, in particular, in case of fall incidents, when people were afraid not to be able to use their existing emergency response systems. The ambient intelligence technologies were initially seen as a welcome addition to strategies already adopted by the respondents, including a variety of home modifications and assistive devices. The systems tested increased the sense of safety and security and helped to postpone institutionalisation. Respondents came up with a set of specifications in terms of the operation and the design of the technology. False alarms were also regarded as a sign that the ambient intelligence technology is functioning. Moreover, a good integration of the new technologies in the provision of health care is indispensable, and installation should be done in an acceptable and unobtrusive manner. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Ambient intelligence technologies can contribute to an increased safety and security at home. The technologies alone offer no all encompassing solution as home care and additional environmental interventions are still needed to support ageing-in-place. Results of the study are used to further improve the ambient intelligence technologies and their implementation.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was (a) to study driver inattention as a trait-like variable and (b) to provide new evidence of validity for the Attention-Related Driving Errors Scale (ARDES). BACKGROUND: Driving inattention is approached from an individual differences perspective. We are interested in how drivers vary in their propensity to experience failures of attention and in the methods to measure these differences. METHOD: In a first sample (n = 301), we tested, via confirmatory factor analysis, a new theoretical model for the ARDES. In a second sample (n = 201), we evaluated the relationship between inattention and internal and external sources of distraction and social desirability bias in ARDES responses. A subsample (n = 65) was reevaluated to study temporal stability of the ARDES scores. RESULTS: Errors measured by the ARDES can be classified according to the driving task level at which they occur (navigation, maneuvering, or control). Differences in ARDES scores based on collision history were observed. ARDES was related to internal sources of distraction and was independent of the level of exposure to distracting activities. Test-retest showed a high degree of stability in ARDES scores. Low correlations were found with a social desirability measure. CONCLUSION: ARDES appears to measure a personal trait that remains relatively stable over time and is relatively independent of distracting activities. New evidence of validity emerged for this self-report. APPLICATION: ARDES can be used to measure individual differences in driving inattention and to help tailor preventive interventions for inattentive drivers. It can serve as an instrument of driver self-assessment in educational and training contexts.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We experimentally tested the degree that the size-weight illusion depends on perceptual conditions allowing the observer to assume that both the visual and the kinesthetic stimuli of a weight seen and lifted emanate from the same object. We expected that the degree of the illusion depended on the\"realism\"provided by different kinds of virtual reality (VR) used when the weights are seen in virtual reality and at the same time lifted in natural reality. BACKGROUND: Welch and Warren (1980) reported that an intermodal influence can be expected only if perceptual information of different modalities is compellingly related to only one object. METHOD: Objects of different sizes and weights were presented to 50 participants in natural reality or in four virtual realities: two immersive head-mounted display VRs (with or without head tracking) and two nonimmersive desktop VRs (with or without screening from input of the natural environment using a visor). The objects' heaviness was scaled using the magnitude estimation method. RESULTS: Data show that the degree of the illusion is largest in immersive and lowest in nonimmersive virtual realities. CONCLUSION: The higher the degree of the illusion is, the more compelling the situation is perceived and the more the observed data are in correspondence with the data predicted for the illusion in natural reality. This shows that the kind of mediating technology used strongly influences the presence experienced. APPLICATION: The size-weight illusion's sensitivity to conditions that affect the sense of presence makes it a promising objective presence measure.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effects of cue error on auditory spatial facilitation (ASF) of visual search. BACKGROUND: ASF is the reduction in time needed to locate and identify a visual target when an auditory cue is presented at the location of the target. Although ASF has been shown to occur when the auditory cue coincides with the target location, it is important to determine whether facilitatory effects are also evident when the cue is displaced. METHOD: Participants performed a visual search task in the presence of an auditory cue that was presented at the center of the screen (uninformative), at the location of the target (accurate), or displaced up to 12 degrees from the target horizontally or vertically. RESULTS: Generally, displaced auditory cues reduced search times as compared with a condition in which the cue was uninformative. When the displacement was always along a single spatial dimension, the cue was as effective as a coincident cue if it was within the local visual area. However, when the dimension along which the cue was displaced varied randomly, the cue did not necessarily reduce search time and hurt performance when the visual search task was difficult. CONCLUSION: Designers of virtual audio displays should be aware that auditory cue accuracy will be affected by the difficulty of the visual task and the operators' knowledge of cue precision and reliability.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the present research, we investigated the hypothesis that working memory mediates conversation-induced impairment of situation awareness (SA) while driving. BACKGROUND: Although there is empirical evidence that conversation impairs driving performance, the cognitive mechanisms that mediate this relationship remain underspecified. Researchers have reported that a phonological working memory task decreased drivers' SA for vehicles located behind them whereas a visuospatial working memory task impaired SA for vehicles ahead. Conversation, therefore, might impair SA for vehicles behind the driver by preferentially taxing the phonological loop. METHOD: A 20-questions task was used as a proxy for natural conversation. In Experiment I, driving performance was measured across three within-subjects conversation conditions (i.e., no conversation, driver asks questions, driver answers questions) with the use of a driving simulator. In Experiment 2, participants drove in the same simulator while either conversing (20-questions task) or not Participants estimated the positions of other vehicles after the screens were blanked at the end of each trial. RESULTS: Speed monitoring and responses to visual probes were impaired by the 20-questions conversation task (Experiment 1). As predicted, conversation impaired SA for the location of other vehicles more for vehicles located behind the driver than for those in front (Experiment 2). CONCLUSION: Conversation impairs drivers' SA of vehicles behind them by taxing working memory's phonological loop and impairs SA generally by taxing working memory's central executive. APPLICATION: Provides a theoretical framework that links driver SA to working memory and a mechanism for understanding why conversation impairs driving performance.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this field experiment, the authors tested an alerting system and a monetary incentive system with the objective of reducing speeding more than 5 mph faster than the posted speed limit. BACKGROUND: Speeding is a factor in a significant number of traffic fatalities. The systems tested in this project have been evaluated outside but not within the United States. These studies indicated that similar systems led to reductions in speeding. METHOD: For this study, eight vehicles were instrumented such that vehicle speed and speed limits were linked in real time. A total of 50 participants drove assigned vehicles for 4 weeks. Week 1 was a baseline period; during Week 2 or Week 3, 40 participants experienced the alerting system that issued auditory and visual advisory signals when drivers exceeded the limit by 5 mph or more. Of these 40 individuals, 20 experienced the monetary incentive system during Weeks 2 and 3; Week 4 was a return-to-baseline period. A control group of 10 drivers experienced neither system during the study. RESULTS: Results indicated that the incentive system resulted in significant reductions in driving faster than the posted limit, and the feedback system led to modest changes in speeding. In the condition in which drivers experienced the feedback and incentive, reductions in speeding were similar to those found during the incentive-only condition. CONCLUSION: The technology tested in this study has potential to benefit traffic safety by reducing the incidence of driving faster than the posted limit, which should lead to a reduction in speed-related crashes.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to clarify how knowledge elaborated by specific experience may lead to erroneous expectations during interactions between drivers and riders. BACKGROUND: Situation awareness is partly determined by prior knowledge. Unshared knowledge may cause difficulties in managing driving interactions, but there is still an important gap in the literature devoted to this field of research. METHOD: There were 226 participants, distinguished according to their vehicle use (for drivers, type of vehicle driven and whether they were exclusive or dual drivers; for motorcycle and scooter riders, the type of powered two-wheeler [PTW] used and its engine size) and their driving experience. Focusing on the most vulnerable users, we studied prior representations to interactions using a series of closed questions on drivers' performance relating to different stages of the interaction process from the perspective both of drivers' self-reflection and of riders' expectations. RESULTS: Although most drivers are self-confident, their abilities tend to be questioned by riders. Owners of medium or large motorbikes feel that drivers do not assess their approach speed accurately. Similarly, scooter riders doubt drivers' ability to assess the distance that separates them from PTWs. Riders who use medium or large motorbikes are more likely to question drivers' skills in relation to crossing situations. Scooter riders do so more often for overtaking situations. CONCLUSION: The development of shared prior knowledge is essential to prevent accidents and incidents between drivers and riders.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: User performance, perceived usability, and preference for five smartphone text input methods were compared with younger and older novice adults. BACKGROUND: Smartphones are used for a variety of functions other than phone calls, including text messaging, e-mail, and web browsing. Research comparing performance with methods of text input on smartphones reveals a high degree of variability in reported measures, procedures, and results. This study reports on a direct comparison of five of the most common input methods among a population of younger and older adults, who had no experience with any of the methods. METHOD: Fifty adults (25 younger, 18-35 years; 25 older, 60-84 years) completed a text entry task using five text input methods (physical Qwerty, onscreen Qwerty, tracing, handwriting, and voice). Entry and error rates, perceived usability, and preference were recorded. RESULTS: Both age groups input text equally fast using voice input, but older adults were slower than younger adults using all other methods. Both age groups had low error rates when using physical Qwerty and voice, but older adults committed more errors with the other three methods. Both younger and older adults preferred voice and physical Qwerty input to the remaining methods. Handwriting consistently performed the worst and was rated lowest by both groups. CONCLUSION: Voice and physical Qwerty input methods proved to be the most effective for both younger and older adults, and handwriting input was the least effective overall.

METHOD: In two studies, participants responded to our PAS measure, interacted with imperfect automated aids, and reported trust. RESULTS: Each of the two PAS measure factors demonstrated fit to the hypothesized factor structure and convergent and discriminant validity when compared with propensity to trust machines and trust in a specific aid. However, the high expectations and all-or-none thinking scales showed low intercorrelations and differential relationships with outcomes, suggesting that they might best be considered two separate constructs rather than two subfactors of the PAS. All-or-none thinking had significant associations with decreases in trust following aid errors, whereas high expectations did not. RESULTS therefore suggest that the all-or-none thinking scale may best represent the PAS construct. CONCLUSION: Our PAS measure (specifically, the all-or-none thinking scale) significantly predicted the severe trust decreases thought to be associated with high PAS. Further, it demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties across two samples. APPLICATION: This measure may be used in future work to assess levels of PAS in users of automated systems in either research or applied settings. Language: en","authors":["Stephanie M.

{"abstract":"Operators in complex event-driven domains must coordinate competing attentional demands in the form of multiple tasks and interactions. This study examined the extent to which this requirement can be supported more effectively through informative interruption cueing (in this case, partial information about the nature of pending tasks). The 48 participants performed a visually demanding air traffic control (ATC) task. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups that differed in the availability of information (not available, available upon request, available automatically) about the urgency and modality of pending interruption tasks. Within-subject variables included ATC-related workload and the modality, frequency, and priority of interruption tasks. The results show that advance knowledge about the nature of pending tasks led participants to delay visual interruption tasks the longest, which allowed them to avoid intramodal interference and scanning costs associated with performing these tasks concurrently with ATC tasks. The 3 experimental groups did not differ significantly in terms of their interruption task performance; however, the group that automatically received task-related information showed better ATC performance, thus experiencing a net performance gain. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of interfaces in support of attention and interruption management in a wide range of event-driven environments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of the present study was to examine to what extent the ability to attain a required headway of 1 or 2 s can be improved through practical driving instruction under real traffic conditions and whether the learning is sustained after a period during which there has been no controlled training. BACKGROUND: The failure of drivers to estimate headways correctly has been demonstrated in previous studies. METHODS: Two methods of training were used: time based (in seconds) and distance based (in a combination of meters and car lengths). For each method, learning curves were examined for 18 participants at speeds of 50, 80, and 100 km\/hr. RESULTS: The results indicated that drivers were weak in estimating headway prior to training using both methods. The learning process was rapid for both methods and similar for all speeds; thus, after one trial with feedback, there was already a significant improvement. The learning was retained over time, for at least the 1 month examined in this study. CONCLUSION: Both the time and distance training of headway improved drivers' ability to attain required headways, with the learning being maintained over a retention interval. The learning process was based on perceptual cues from the driving scene and feedback from the experimenter, regardless of the formal training method. APPLICATION: The implications of these results are that all drivers should be trained in headway estimation using an objective distance measuring device, which can be installed on driver instruction vehicles.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore human factors aspects of reality-based \"force-on-force\" (FoF) handgun practice through a within-subjects field experiment that assessed subjective stress measurements, biomarker regulation, performance outcomes, and behavioral adaptations. BACKGROUND: FoF handgun practice is a recent training asset for armed officers whereby dynamic opponents may act, react, and even retaliate with specially designed marker ammunition. Predesigned scenarios enable trainees to practice in a simulated real-life environment. METHOD: A sample of experienced military personnel (N = 20) ran a handgun workshop in two conditions: FoF practice and traditional cardboard-target practice. Intra-individual assessments included anticipated distress, subjective stress, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), shooting accuracy, and directly observable training seriousness. RESULTS: Compared with the standard cardboard practice condition, FoF exposure caused significant increases in anticipatory distress, subjective stress, and sAA secretion. Furthermore, participants' first encounter with FoF practice (vs. cardboard practice) substantially degraded their shooting performance and had a significant positive impact on the earnestness with which they approached their mission during the workshop. CONCLUSION: FoF practice is an effective training tool for armed officers because it simulates a realistic work environment by increasing task-specific stress such that it affects important outcomes of professional performance and leads to desirable behavioral changes during training. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the introduction of biomarker assessments in human factors research and the design, based on reality-based practice, of effective training procedures for high-reliability professionals.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether stress training introduced during the acquisition of simulator-based flight skills enhances pilot performance during subsequent stressful flight operations in an actual aircraft. BACKGROUND: Despite knowledge that preconditions to aircraft accidents can be strongly influenced by pilot stress, little is known about the effectiveness of stress training and how it transfers to operational flight settings. METHOD: For this study, 30 participants with no flying experience were assigned at random to a stress-trained treatment group or a control group. Stress training consisted of systematic pairing of skill acquisition in a flight simulator with stress coping mechanisms in the presence of a cold pressor. Control participants received identical flight skill acquisition training but without stress training. Participants then performed a stressful flying task in a Piper Archer aircraft. RESULTS: Stress-trained research participants flew the aircraft more smoothly, as recorded by aircraft telemetry data, and generally better, as recorded by flight instructor evaluations, than did control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing stress coping mechanisms during flight training improved performance in a stressful flying task. APPLICATION: The results of this study indicate that stress training during the acquisition of flight skills may serve to enhance pilot performance in stressful operational flight and, therefore, might mitigate the contribution of pilot stress to aircraft mishaps.

{"abstract":"Recent \"naturalistic\" theories of decision making emphasize the role of stored prior experiences or cases as a guide to current action. However, there is little empirical evidence on the role that case-based remindings play in real-life decision making. The present study utilized a Web-based survey to collect data about the role of prior cases in pilot decision making about critical flight events. Results showed that more than half of the 1081 pilots who responded could provide details about utilizing a previous case in responding to a critical flight event. These events were most likely to involve weather or equipment failure. The cases were found to be useful in situational assessment rather than option evaluation. The use of cases increased with age and experience. Data obtained from a concurrent conventional survey showed broadly similar results. The implications of these results are that case-based remindings play an important role in expert pilot decision making and that a training system that incorporates case-based learning would be a potentially useful means of improving pilot decision making. Actual or potential applications of this research include the development of case-based training systems to enhance flight training. Language: en","authors":["David O'Hare","Mark W.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article is to illustrate the problem-driven, cumulative, and highly interdisciplinary nature of human factors research by providing a brief overview of the work on mode errors on modern flight decks over the past two decades. BACKGROUND: Mode errors on modem flight decks were first reported in the late 1980s. Poor feedback, inadequate mental models of the automation, and the high degree of coupling and complexity of flight deck systems were identified as main contributors to these breakdowns in human-automation interaction. Various improvements of design, training, and procedures were proposed to address these issues. METHODS: The author describes when and why the problem of mode errors surfaced, summarizes complementary research activities that helped identify and understand the contributing factors to mode errors, and describes some countermeasures that have been developed in recent years. RESULTS: This brief review illustrates how one particular human factors problem in the aviation domain enabled various disciplines and methodological approaches to contribute to a better understanding of, as well as provide better support for, effective human-automation coordination.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of the passenger head-tilt strategy on the severity of carsickness in lateral acceleration situations in automobiles. BACKGROUND: It is well known that the driver is generally less susceptible to carsickness than are the passengers. However, it is also known that the driver tilts his or her head toward the curve center when negotiating a curve, whereas the passenger's head moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, we hypothesized that the head-tilt strategy has the effect of reducing the severity of carsickness. METHOD: A passenger car was driven on a quasi-oval track with a pylon slalom while the participant sat in the navigator seat. The experiment was terminated when either the participant felt the initial symptoms of motion sickness or the car finished 20 laps. In the natural head-tilt condition, the participants were instructed to sit naturally, to relax, and not to oppose the lateral acceleration intentionally. In the active head-tilt condition, the participants were asked to tilt their heads against the centrifugal acceleration, thus imitating the driver's head tilt. RESULTS: The number of laps achieved in the active condition was significantly greater than that in the natural condition. In addition, the subjective ratings of motion sickness and symptoms in the active condition were significantly lower than those in the natural condition. CONCLUSION: We suggest that an active head tilt against centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The performance of human operators acting within closed-loop control systems is investigated in a classic tracking task. The dependence of the control error (tracking error) on the parameters display gain, k(display), and input signal frequency bandwidth, f(g), which alter task difficulty and presumably the control delay, is studied with the aim of functionally specifying it via a model. BACKGROUND: The human operator as an element of a cascaded human-machine control system (e.g., car driving or piloting an airplane) codetermines the overall system performance. Control performance of humans in continuous tracking has been described in earlier studies. METHOD: Using a handheld joystick, 10 participants tracked continuous random input signals. The parameters f(g) and k(display) were altered between experiments. RESULTS: Increased task difficulty promoted lengthened control delay and, consequently, increased control error.Tracking performance degraded profoundly with target deflection components above 1 Hz, confirming earlier reports. CONCLUSION: The control error is composed of a delay-induced component, a demand-based component, and a novel component: a human tracking limit. Accordingly, a new model that allows concepts of the observed control error to be split into these three components is suggested. APPLICATION: To achieve optimal performance in control systems that include a human operator (e.g., vehicles, remote controlled rovers, crane control), (a) tasks should be kept as simple as possible to achieve shortest control delays, and (b) task components requiring higher-frequency (> 1 Hz) tracking actions should be avoided or automated by technical systems.

BACKGROUND: Technologies relevant to older adults often display small images, though no studies have examined whether these systems are usable for this population. Given the importance of successful emotional processing, we draw on research showing age-related difficulties in processing negative emotions to examine older adults' performance on images with reduced sizes. METHODS: Sixty participants, 20 in each age group, were shown the names of emotions, followed by a facial expression, and were asked to indicate as rapidly as possible if they matched. RESULTS: For response time we found an interaction of age and window size, showing that older adults, unlike younger adults, are slower with small sizes than with large sizes. For accuracy, we found an interaction of age and emotion, indicating that older adults are less accurate in the perception of fearful, sad, and surprised stimuli.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the validity of the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ) in predicting dual-task interference. BACKGROUND: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. METHOD: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r(2) between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. RESULTS: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. CONCLUSION: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Examine how driving experience and expectations affect the ability of experienced drivers to identify traffic signs--specifically, no right turn (NRT) and no left turn (NLT) at intersections. BACKGROUND: Failure to heed signs is a frequent cause of accidents, and the authors focused on the contributions of experience and expectancy to sign identification. METHOD: Inexperienced and experienced drivers were connected to an eye tracker system and briefly exposed to various traffic scenes. Some of the pictures included an NRT sign at the expected location (on the right), and some included the same sign at an unexpected location (on the left). The same procedure was used with an NLT traffic sign. RESULTS: Experienced drivers identified traffic signs better than inexperienced drivers did when the signs were posted at the expected location but identified them worse than did inexperienced drivers when they were at unexpected locations. CONCLUSIONS: With experience, drivers' expectations regarding the expected location of traffic signs become so strong that violating these expectancies results in more identification errors among experienced drivers than among inexperienced drivers. To optimize experienced drivers' traffic sign identification, signs must be located in accordance with drivers' expectations--specifically, on the right side of the road. APPLICATIONS: When signs are misplaced, crashes can be caused by inappropriate placement rather than inappropriate driving. Highway designers should ensure that their design conforms to standards that shape experienced drivers' expectations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate two cusp catastrophe models for cognitive workload and fatigue. They share similar cubic polynomial structures but derive from different underlying processes and contain variables that contribute to flexibility with respect to load and the ability to compensate for fatigue. BACKGROUND: Cognitive workload and fatigue both have a negative impact on performance and have been difficult to separate. Extended time on task can produce fatigue, but it can also produce a positive effect from learning or automaticity. METHOD: In this two-part experiment, 129 undergraduates performed tasks involving spelling, arithmetic, memory, and visual search. RESULTS: The fatigue cusp for the central memory task was supported with the quantity of work performed and performance on an episodic memory task acting as the control parameters. There was a strong linear effect, however. The load manipulations for the central task were competition with another participant for rewards, incentive conditions, and time pressure. Results supported the workload cusp in which trait anxiety and the incentive manipulation acted as the control parameters. CONCLUSION: The cusps are generally better than linear models for analyzing workload and fatigue phenomena; practice effects can override fatigue. Future research should investigate multitasking and task sequencing issues, physical-cognitive task combinations, and a broader range of variables that contribute to flexibility with respect to load or compensate for fatigue.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated whether performance across a range of cue-based cognitive tasks differentiated the diagnostic performance of power control operators into three distinct groups, characteristic of novice, competence, and expertise. BACKGROUND: Despite its increasing importance in the contemporary workplace, there is little understanding of the cognitive processes that distinguish novice, competent, and expert performance in the context of remote diagnosis. However, recent evidence suggests that cue acquisition and utilization may represent a mechanism by which the transition from novice to expertise occurs. METHOD: The study involved the application of four distinct cue-based tasks within the context of power system control. A total of 65 controllers, encompassing a range of industry experience, completed the tasks as part of an in-service training program.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We tested the possibility that monitoring a display wherein critical signals for detection were defined by a stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) image might be more resistant to the vigilance decrement, and to temporal declines in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), than monitoring a display featuring a customary two-dimensional (2-D) image. BACKGROUND: Hancock has asserted that vigilance studies typically employ stimuli for detection that do not exemplify those that occur in the natural world. As a result, human performance is suboptimal. From this perspective, tasks that better approximate perception in natural environments should enhance performance efficiency. To test that possibility, we made use of stereopsis, an important means by which observers interact with their everyday surroundings. METHOD: Observers monitored a circular display in which a vertical line was embedded. Critical signals for detection in a 2-D condition were instances in which the line was rotated clockwise from vertical. In a 3-D condition, critical signals were cases in which the line appeared to move outward toward the observer. RESULTS: The overall level of signal detection and the stability of detection over time were greater when observers monitored for 3-D changes in target depth compared to 2-D changes in target orientation. However, the 3-D display did not retard the temporal decline in CBFV. CONCLUSION: These results provide the initial demonstration that 3-D displays can enhance performance in vigilance tasks. APPLICATION: The use of 3-D displays may be productive in augmenting system reliability when operator vigilance is vital. Language: en","authors":["Eric T. Greenlee","Gregory J. Funke","Joel S.

{"abstract":"Objective: In the present study, we sought to investigate whether auditory and tactile cuing could be used to facilitate a complex, real-world air traffic management scenario. Background: Auditory and tactile cuing provides an effective means of improving both the speed and accuracy of participants' performance in a variety of laboratory-based visual target detection and identification tasks. Method: A low-fidelity air traffic simulation task was used in which participants monitored and controlled aircraft. The participants had to ensure that the aircraft landed or exited at the correct altitude, speed, and direction and that they maintained a safe separation from all other aircraft and boundaries. The performance measures recorded included en route time, handoff delay, and conflict resolution delay (the performance measure of interest). In a baseline condition, the aircraft in conflict was highlighted in red (visual cue), and in the experimental conditions, this standard visual cue was accompanied by a simultaneously presented auditory, vibrotactile, or audiotactile cue. Results: Participants responded significantly more rapidly, but no less accurately, to conflicts when presented with an additional auditory or audiotactile cue than with either a vibrotactile or visual cue alone.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether a gene known to influence dopamine availability in the prefrontal cortex is associated with individual differences in learning a supervisory control task. BACKGROUND: Methods are needed for selection and training of human operators who can effectively supervise multiple unmanned vehicles (UVs). Compared to the valine (Val) allele, the methionine (Met) allele of the COMT gene has been linked to superior executive function, but it is not known whether it is associated with training-related effects in multi-UV supervisory control performance. METHOD: Ninety-nine healthy adults were genotyped for the COMT Val158Met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4680) and divided into Met\/Met, Val\/Met, and Val\/Val groups. Participants supervised six UVs in an air defense mission requiring them to attack incoming enemy aircraft and protect a no-fly zone from intruders in conditions of low and high task load (numbers of enemy aircraft). Training effects were examined across four blocks of trials in each task load condition. RESULTS: Compared to the Val\/Met and Val\/Val groups, Met\/Met individuals exhibited a greater increase in enemy targets destroyed and greater reduction in enemy red zone incursions across training blocks. CONCLUSION: Individuals with the COMT Met\/Met genotype can acquire skill in executive function tasks, such as multi-UV supervisory control, to a higher level and\/or faster than other genotype groups. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the development of individualized training methods for operators of multi-UV systems and selecting personnel for complex supervisory control tasks.

{"abstract":"Social exclusion and risk-taking are both common experiences of concern in adolescence, yet little is known about how the two may be related at behavioral or neural levels. In this fMRI study, adolescents (N=27, 14 male, 14-17 years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported resistance to peer influence (RPI). When making risky decisions after social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels of activity in right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also associated with lower levels of activity in lPFC during crashes following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in lPFC was not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing and\/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. Language: en","authors":["Shannon J.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to identify the most frequently occurring human factors contributing to maintenance-related failures within a petroleum industry organization. Commonality between failures will assist in understanding reliability in maintenance processes, thereby preventing accidents in high-hazard domains. BACKGROUND: Methods exist for understanding the human factors contributing to accidents. Their application in a maintenance context mainly has been advanced in aviation and nuclear power. Maintenance in the petroleum industry provides a different context for investigating the role that human factors play in influencing outcomes. It is therefore worth investigating the contributing human factors to improve our understanding of both human factors in reliability and the factors specific to this domain. METHOD: Detailed analyses were conducted of maintenance-related failures (N = 38) in a petroleum company using structured interviews with maintenance technicians. The interview structure was based on the Human Factor Investigation Tool (HFIT), which in turn was based on Rasmussen's model of human malfunction. RESULTS: A mean of 9.5 factors per incident was identified across the cases investigated.The three most frequent human factors contributing to the maintenance failures were found to be assumption (79% of cases), design and maintenance (71%), and communication (66%). CONCLUSION: HFIT proved to be a useful instrument for identifying the pattern of human factors that recurred most frequently in maintenance-related failures. APPLICATION: The high frequency of failures attributed to assumptions and communication demonstrated the importance of problem-solving abilities and organizational communication in a domain where maintenance personnel have a high degree of autonomy and a wide geographical distribution.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This article provides a review of recent models of driver behavior in on-road collision situations. BACKGROUND: In efforts to improve traffic safety, computer simulation of accident situations holds promise as a valuable tool, for both academia and industry. However, to ensure the validity of simulations, models are needed that accurately capture near-crash driver behavior, as observed in real traffic or driving experiments. METHOD: Scientific articles were identified by a systematic approach, including extensive database searches. Criteria for inclusion were defined and applied, including the requirement that models should have been previously applied to simulate on-road collision avoidance behavior. Several selected models were implemented and tested in selected scenarios. RESULTS: The reviewed articles were grouped according to a rough taxonomy based on main emphasis, namely avoidance by braking, avoidance by steering, avoidance by a combination of braking and steering, effects of driver states and characteristics on avoidance, and simulation platforms. CONCLUSION: A large number of near-collision driver behavior models have been proposed. Validation using human driving data has often been limited, but exceptions exist. The research field appears fragmented, but simulation-based comparison indicates that there may be more similarity between models than what is apparent from the model equations. Further comparison of models is recommended. APPLICATION: This review provides traffic safety researchers with an overview of the field of driver models for collision situations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to quantify and compare performance of middle-aged and older drivers during a naturalistic distraction paradigm (visual search for roadside targets) and to predict older drivers performance given functioning in visual, motor, and cognitive domains. BACKGROUND: Distracted driving can imperil healthy adults and may disproportionally affect the safety of older drivers with visual, motor, and cognitive decline. METHOD: A total of 203 drivers, 120 healthy older (61 men and 59 women, ages 65 years and older) and 83 middle-aged drivers (38 men and 45 women, ages 40 to 64 years), participated in an on-road test in an instrumented vehicle. Outcome measures included performance in roadside target identification (traffic signs and restaurants) and concurrent driver safety. Differences in visual, motor, and cognitive functioning served as predictors. RESULTS: Older drivers identified fewer landmarks and drove slower but committed more safety errors than did middle-aged drivers. Greater familiarity with local roads benefited performance of middle-aged but not older drivers.Visual cognition predicted both traffic sign identification and safety errors, and executive function predicted traffic sign identification over and above vision. CONCLUSION: Older adults are susceptible to driving safety errors while distracted by common secondary visual search tasks that are inherent to driving. The findings underscore that age-related cognitive decline affects older drivers' management of driving tasks at multiple levels and can help inform the design of on-road tests and interventions for older drivers.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to answer the question, Do drivers take into account the action boundaries of their car when overtaking? BACKGROUND: The Morice et al. affordance-based approach to visually guided overtaking suggests that the \"overtake-ability\" affordance can be formalized as the ratio of the \"minimum satisfying velocity\" (MSV) of the maneuver to the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the driven car. In this definition, however, the maximum acceleration (Amax) of the vehicle is ignored. We hypothesize that drivers may be sensitive to an affordance redefined with the ratio of the \"minimum satisfying acceleration\" (MSA) to the Amax of the car. METHOD: Two groups of nine drivers drove cars differing in their Amax. They were instructed to attempt overtaking maneuvers in 25 situations resulting from the combination of five MSA and five MSV values. RESULTS: When overtaking frequency was expressed as a function of MSV and MSA, maneuvers were found to be initiated differently for the two groups. However, when expressed as a function of MSV\/Vmax and MSA\/Amax, overtaking frequency was quite similar for both groups. Finally, a multiple regression coefficient analysis demonstrated that overtaking decisions are fully explained by a composite variable comprising MSA\/Amax and the time required to reach MSV. CONCLUSION: Drivers reliably decide whether overtaking is safe (or not) by using low- and high-order variables taking into account their car's maximum velocity and acceleration, respectively, as predicted by \"affordance-based control\" theory. APPLICATION: Potential applications include the design of overtaking assistance, which should exploit the MSA\/Amax variables in order to suggest perceptually relevant overtaking solutions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We assess the driving distraction potential of texting with Google Glass (Glass), a mobile wearable platform capable of receiving and sending short-message-service and other messaging formats. BACKGROUND: A known roadway danger, texting while driving has been targeted by legislation and widely banned. Supporters of Glass claim the head-mounted wearable computer is designed to deliver information without concurrent distraction. Existing literature supports the supposition that design decisions incorporated in Glass might facilitate messaging for drivers. METHOD: We asked drivers in a simulator to drive and use either Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface, then interrupted them with an emergency brake event. Both the response event and subsequent recovery were analyzed. RESULTS: Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting cognitive demands. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multitasking. CONCLUSION: Glass in not a panacea as some supporters claim, but it does point the way to design interventions that effect reduced load in multitasking.

{"abstract":"Recent free flight proposals to relax airspace constraints and give greater autonomy to aircraft have raised concerns about their impact on controller performance. Relaxing route and altitude restrictions would reduce the regularity of traffic through individual sectors, possibly impairing controller situation awareness. We examined the impact of this reduced regularity in four visual search experiments that tested controllers' detection of traffic conflicts in the four conditions created by factorial manipulation of fixed routes (present vs. absent) and altitude restrictions (present vs. absent). These four conditions were tested under varying levels of traffic load and conflict geometry (conflict time and conflict angle). Traffic load and conflict geometry showed strong and consistent effects in all experiments. Color coding altitude also substantially improved detection times. In contrast, removing altitude restrictions had only a small negative impact, and removing route restrictions had virtually no negative impact. In some cases conflict detection was actually better without fixed routes. The implications and limitations of these results for the feasibility of free flight are discussed. Actual or potential applications include providing guidance in the selection of free flight operational concepts. Language: en","authors":["Roger W. Remington","James C.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the cognitive components required for offshore drillers to develop and maintain situation awareness (SA) while controlling subsea hydrocarbon wells. BACKGROUND: SA issues are often identified as contributing factors to drilling incidents, most recently in the Deepwater Horizon blowout. Yet, there is a limited body of research investigating SA in the offshore drilling environment. METHOD: In the first study, critical incident interviews were conducted with 18 experienced drilling personnel. Transcripts were subjected to theory-driven thematic analysis, producing a preliminary cognitive framework of how drillers develop and maintain SA during well control. In the second study, 24 hr of observations (in vivo and video) of drillers managing a high fidelity well-control simulator were analyzed to further develop the framework. RESULTS: The cognitive components that enable drillers to build up an understanding of what is happening in the wellbore and surrounding environment, to predict how this understanding may develop, were identified. These components included cue recognition, interpretation of information in conjunction with the current mental model, and projection through mental simulation. Factors such as distracters, expectations, and information sharing between crew members can both positively and negatively influence the drillers' SA. CONCLUSION: The findings give a preliminary understanding into the components of drillers' SA, highlighting the importance of SA for safe and effective performance and indicating that Endsley's model of SA can be applied to drilling.

METHOD: In this experiment, 141 undergraduates responded to target stimuli that appeared on a simulated security camera display at three rates of speed while completing a jigsaw puzzle. Participants worked alone or in pairs and completed additional measurements prior to or after the main tasks. RESULTS: The workload cusp verified the expected effects of speed and frustration on change in performance. The fatigue cusp showed that positive and negative changes in performance were greater if more work on the secondary task was completed and whether the participants who started with the fast vigilance condition demonstrated less fatigue. CONCLUSION: The results supported the efficacy of the cusp models and suggested, furthermore, that training modules that varied speed of presentation could buffer the effects of fatigue. APPLICATION: The cusp models can be used to analyze virtually any cognitively demanding task set. The particular results generalize to vigilance tasks, although a wider range of conditions within vigilance tasks needs to be investigated further. Language: en","authors":["Stephen J.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A driving simulator was used to assess the impact on fatigue, stress, and workload of full vehicle automation that was initiated by the driver. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that mandatory use of full automation induces a state of \"passive fatigue\" associated with loss of alertness. By contrast, voluntary use of automation may enhance the driver's perceptions of control and ability to manage fatigue. METHOD: Participants were assigned to one of two experimental conditions, automation optional (AO) and nonautomation (NA), and then performed a 35 min, monotonous simulated drive. In the last 5 min, automation was unavailable and drivers were required to respond to an emergency event. Subjective state and workload were evaluated before and after the drive. RESULTS: Making automation available to the driver failed to alleviate fatigue and stress states induced by driving in monotonous conditions. Drivers who were fatigued prior to the drive were more likely to choose to use automation, but automation use increased distress, especially in fatigue-prone drivers. Drivers in the AO condition were slower to initiate steering responses to the emergency event, suggesting optional automation may be distracting. CONCLUSION: Optional, driver-controlled automation appears to pose the same dangers to task engagement and alertness as externally initiated automation. APPLICATION: Drivers of automated vehicles may be vulnerable to fatigue that persists when normal vehicle control is restored. It is important to evaluate automated systems' impact on driver fatigue, to seek design solutions to the issue of maintaining driver engagement, and to address the vulnerabilities of fatigue-prone drivers.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of shared leadership within and across teams in multiteam systems (MTS) on team goal attainment and MTS success. BACKGROUND: Due to different and sometimes competing goals in MTS, leadership is required within and across teams. Shared leadership, the effectiveness of which has been proven in single teams, may be an effective strategy to cope with these challenges. METHOD: We observed leadership in 84 cockpit and cabin crews that collaborated in the form of six-member MTS aircrews (N = 504) during standardized simulations of an in-flight emergency. Leadership was coded by three trained observers using a structured observation system. Team goal attainment was assessed by two subject matter experts using a checklist-based rating tool. MTS goal attainment was measured objectively on the basis of the outcome of the simulated flights. RESULTS: In successful MTS aircrews, formal leaders and team members displayed significantly more leadership behaviors, shared leadership by pursers and flight attendants predicted team goal attainment, and pursers' shared leadership across team boundaries predicted cross-team goal attainment. In cockpit crews, leadership was not shared and captains' vertical leadership predicted team goal attainment regardless of MTS success. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in general, shared leadership positively relates to team goal attainment and MTS success,whereby boundary spanners' dual leadership role is key. APPLICATION: Leadership training in MTS should address shared rather than merely vertical forms of leadership, and component teams in MTS should be trained together with emphasis on boundary spanners' dual leadership role. Furthermore, team members should be empowered to engage in leadership processes when required.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of landmark information of varying quality within drivers' navigation instructions on driving and navigation performance when navigating an unfamiliar route. BACKGROUND: Current vehicle navigation systems predominantly use distance-to-turn information to enable a driver to locate a forthcoming maneuver. Although it has been proposed that the design of driver navigation aids can be improved through the incorporation of landmarks as key navigation cues, little research has investigated how the quality of the landmark affects driver behavior. METHOD: An empirical field trial in a real traffic environment was undertaken with 48 participants in order to assess the effect of landmark quality on driver behavior when navigating an unfamiliar, complex, urban route. RESULTS: The use of good landmarks (as opposed to poor landmarks or distance information) as key verbal navigation cues resulted in significant improvements in navigation performance, driving performance, and driver confidence immediately preceding a turn. The use of distance information to locate a turn resulted in significantly more glances to the in-vehicle display. CONCLUSIONS: Good landmarks offer significant safety and performance benefits to a driver navigating an unfamiliar route. Poor landmarks can result in driver performance worse than that obtained using distance to turn to locate forthcoming maneuvers. APPLICATION: The design of future vehicle navigation systems should not rely on distance-to turn information alone to enable a driver to locate forthcoming maneuvers but, rather, should incorporate good landmarks within the navigation instructions they present to drivers.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this simulator-based study, we aimed to quantify performance differences between joystick steering systems using first-order and second-order control, which are used in underground coal mining shuttle cars. In addition, we conducted an exploratory analysis of how users of the more difficult, second-order system changed their behavior over time. BACKGROUND: Evidence from the visuomotor control literature suggests that higher-order control devices are not intuitive, which could pose a significant risk to underground mine personnel, equipment, and infrastructure. METHOD: Thirty-six naive participants were randomly assigned to first- and second-order conditions and completed three experimental trials comprising sequences of 90 degrees turns in a virtual underground mine environment, with velocity held constant at 9 km\/h(-1). Performance measures were lateral deviation, steering angle variability, high-frequency steering content, joystick activity, and cumulative time in collision with the virtual mine wall. RESULTS: The second-order control group exhibited significantly poorer performance for all outcome measures. In addition, a series of correlation analyses revealed that changes in strategy were evident in the second-order group but not the first-order group. CONCLUSION: Results were consistent with previous literature indicating poorer performance with higher-order control devices and caution against the adoption of the second-order joystick system for underground shuttle cars.

{"abstract":"Much of the literature of information science and knowledge organization has accepted and built upon Elaine Svenonius's (2004) claim that \"paradigmatic relationships are those that are context-free, definitional, and true in all possible worlds\" (p. 583). At the same time, the literature demonstrates a common understanding that paradigmatic relations are the kinds of semantic relations used in thesauri and other knowledge organization systems (including equivalence relations, hierarchical relations, and associative relations). This understanding is problematic and harmful because it directs attention away from the empirical and contextual basis for knowledge-organizing systems. Whether A is a kind of X is certainly not context-free and definitional in empirical sciences or in much everyday information. Semantic relations are theory-dependent and, in biology, for example, a scientific revolution has taken place in which many relations have changed following the new taxonomic paradigm named \"cladism.\" This biological example is not an exception, but the norm. Semantic relations including paradigmatic relations are not a priori but are dependent on subject knowledge, scientific findings, and paradigms. As long as information scientists and knowledge organizers isolate themselves from subject knowledge, knowledge organization cannot possibly progress.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a set of experiments to examine the utility of several different uni- and multimodal collision avoidance systems (CASs) on driving performance of young and older adult drivers in a high-fidelity simulator. BACKGROUND: Although previous research has examined the efficacy of different CASs on collision avoidance, there has been a dearth of studies that have examined such devices in different driving situations with different populations of drivers. METHOD: Several different CAS warnings were examined in varying traffic and collision configurations both without (Experiment 1a) and with (Experiment 2) a distracting in-vehicle task. RESULTS: Overall, collision avoidance performance for both potential forward and side object collisions was best for an auditory\/visual CAS, which alerted drivers using both modalities. Interestingly, older drivers (60-82 years of age) benefited as much as younger drivers from the CAS, and sometimes they benefited more. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CASs can be beneficial across a number of different driving scenarios, types of collisions, and driver populations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine pilots' automation monitoring strategies and performance on highly automated commercial flight decks. BACKGROUND: A considerable body of research and operational experience has documented breakdowns in pilot-automation coordination on modern flight decks. These breakdowns are often considered symptoms of monitoring failures even though, to date, only limited and mostly anecdotal data exist concerning pilots' monitoring strategies and performance. METHOD: Twenty experienced B-747-400 airline pilots flew a 1-hr scenario involving challenging automation-related events on a full-mission simulator. Behavioral, mental model, and eye-tracking data were collected. RESULTS: The findings from this study confirm that pilots monitor basic flight parameters to a much greater extent than visual indications of the automation configuration. More specifically, they frequently fail to verify manual mode selections or notice automatic mode changes. In other cases, they do not process mode annunciations in sufficient depth to understand their implications for aircraft behavior. Low system observability and gaps in pilots' understanding of complex automation modes were shown to contribute to these problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings describe and explain shortcomings in pilot's automation monitoring strategies and performance based on converging behavioral, eye-tracking, and mental model data. They confirm that monitoring failures are one major contributor to breakdowns in pilot-automation interaction. APPLICATION: The findings from this research can inform the design of improved training programs and automation interfaces that support more effective system monitoring.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to evaluate heavy-truck drivers' following behavior and how a crash warning system influences their headway maintenance. BACKGROUND: Rear-end crashes are one of the major crash types involving heavy trucks and are more likely than other crash types to result in fatalities. Previous studies have observed positive effects of in-vehicle crash warning systems in passenger car drivers. Although heavy-truck drivers are generally more experienced, driver-related errors are still the leading factors contributing to heavy-truck-related rear-end crashes. METHOD: Data from a 10-month naturalistic driving study were used. Participants were 18 professional heavy-truck drivers who received warnings during the last 8 months of the study (treatment period) but not during the first 2 months (baseline period). Time headway and driver's brake reaction time were extracted and compared with condition variables, including one between-subjects variable (driver shift) and five within-subjects variables (treatment condition, roadway types, traffic density, wiper state, and trailer configuration). RESULTS: The presence of warnings resulted in a 0.28-s increase of mean time headway with dense on-road traffic and a 0.20-s increase with wipers on. Drivers also responded to the forward conflicts significantly faster (by 0.26 s, a 15% enhancement) in the treatment condition compared with responses in the baseline condition. CONCLUSION: Positive effects on heavy-truck drivers' following performance were observed with the warning system. APPLICATION: The installation of such in-vehicle crash warning systems can help heavy-truck drivers help avoid close following in challenging situations and respond quicker to potential traffic conflicts, therefore possibly increasing heavy-truck longitudinal driving safety.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an algorithm for detecting drowsiness-related lane departures by applying a random forest classifier to steering wheel angle data. BACKGROUND: Although algorithms exist to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness, the high rate of false alarms and missed detection of drowsiness represent persistent challenges. Current algorithms use a variety of data sources, definitions of drowsiness, and machine learning approaches to detect drowsiness. METHOD: We develop a new approach for detecting drowsiness-related lane departures using steering wheel angle data that employ an ensemble definition of drowsiness and a random forest algorithm. Data collected from 72 participants driving the National Advanced Driving Simulator are used to train and evaluate the model. The model's performance was assessed relative to a commonly used algorithm, percentage eye closure (PERCLOS). RESULTS: The random forest steering algorithm had a higher classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than PERCLOS and had comparable positive predictive value. The algorithm succeeds at identifying two key scenarios associated with the drowsiness detection task. These two scenarios consist of instances when drivers depart their lane because they fail to modulate their steering behavior according to the demands of the simulated road and instances when drivers correctly modulate their steering behavior according to the demands of the road. CONCLUSION: The random forest steering algorithm is a promising approach to detect driver drowsiness. The algorithm's ties to consequences of drowsy driving suggest that it can be easily paired with mitigation systems. Language: en","authors":["Anthony D. McDonald","John D.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This brief review covers the 50 years of driving-related research published in Human Factors, its contribution to driving safety, and emerging challenges. BACKGROUND: Many factors affect driving safety, making it difficult to assess the impact of specific factors such as driver age, cell phone distractions, or collision warnings. METHOD: The author considers the research themes associated with the approximately 270 articles on driving published in Human Factors in the past 50 years. RESULTS: To a large extent, current and past research has explored similar themes and concepts. Many articles published in the first 25 years focused on issues such as driver impairment, individual differences, and perceptual limits. Articles published in the past 25 years address similar issues but also point toward vehicle technology that can exacerbate or mitigate the negative effect of these issues. Conceptual and computational models have played an important role in this research. CONCLUSION: Improved crash-worthiness has contributed to substantial improvements in driving safety over the past 50 years, but future improvements will depend on enhancing driver performance and perhaps, more important, improving driver behavior. Developing models to guide this research will become more challenging as new technology enters the vehicle and shifts the focus from driver performance to driver behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study explores operators' ability to use a multidimensional, nonveridical control display. BACKGROUND: Veridical displays represent realistic scenes. State space displays represent nonveridical n-dimensional information based on informative coordinate axes plus variable features such as color and shading. Empirical investigation of state space displays is relatively new to human factors research. METHOD: Twelve licensed general aviation pilots flew flight scenarios, trying to deviate as little as possible from a preassigned course while still maintaining standard en route separation from traffic. Flight performance using only a veridical cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) was compared with performance using the CDTI augmented by a 4-D nonveridical state space collision avoidance system (CDTI+4CAS). RESULTS: Using moderate traffic density and complex traffic geometry, the CDTI+4CAS condition showed performance superiority over the baseline CDTI-only condition for five of five dependent measures of maneuver efficiency, four of four measures of maneuver safety, and six of nine measures of user workload.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether the Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) and the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) predict incremental variance in performance on a simulated submarine track management task and to measure the potential disruptive effect of these situation awareness (SA) measures. BACKGROUND: Submarine track managers use various displays to localize and track contacts detected by own-ship sensors. The measurement of SA is crucial for designing effective submarine display interfaces and training programs. METHOD: Participants monitored a tactical display and sonar bearing-history display to track the cumulative behaviors of contacts in relationship to own-ship position and landmarks. SPAM (or SAGAT) and the Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) were administered during each scenario, and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and Situation Awareness Rating Technique were administered postscenario. RESULTS: SPAM and SAGAT predicted variance in performance after controlling for subjective measures of SA and workload, and SA for past information was a stronger predictor than SA for current\/future information. The NASA-TLX predicted performance on some tasks. Only SAGAT predicted variance in performance on all three tasks but marginally increased subjective workload. CONCLUSION: SPAM, SAGAT, and the NASA-TLX can predict unique variance in submarine track management performance. SAGAT marginally increased subjective workload, but this increase did not lead to any performance decrement. APPLICATION: Defense researchers have identified SPAM as an alternative to SAGAT because it would not require field exercises involving submarines to be paused. SPAM was not disruptive, but it is potentially problematic that SPAM did not predict variance in all three performance tasks. Language: en","authors":["Shayne Loft","Vanessa K. Bowden","Janelle E.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate display formats for an automated combat identification (CID) aid. BACKGROUND: Verbally informing users of automation reliability improves reliance on automated CID systems. A display can provide reliability information in real time. METHOD: We developed and tested four visual displays that showed both target identity and system reliability information. Display type (pie, random mesh) and display proximity (integrated, separated) of identity and reliability information were manipulated. In Experiment 1, participants used the displays while engaging targets in a simulated combat environment. In Experiment 2, participants briefly viewed still scenes from the simulation. RESULTS: Participants relied on the automation more appropriately with the integrated display than with the separated display. Participants using the random mesh display showed greater sensitivity than those using a pie chart. However, in Experiment 2, the sensitivity effects were limited to lower reliability levels. CONCLUSION: The integrated display format and the random mesh display were the most effective displays tested. APPLICATION: We recommend the use of the integrated format and a random mesh display to indicate identity and reliability information with an automated CID system.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish the nature of choice in cognitive multitasking. BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies of multitasking suggest people are rational in their switch choices regarding multitasking, whereas observational studies suggest they are not. Threaded cognition theory predicts that switching is opportunistic and depends on availability of cognitive resources. METHOD: A total of 21 participants answered e-mails by looking up information (similar to customer service employees) while being interrupted by chat messages. They were free to choose when to switch to the chat message. We analyzed the switching behavior and the time they needed to complete the primary mail task. RESULTS: When participants are faced with a delay in the e-mail task, they switch more often to the chat task at high-workload points. Choosing to switch to the secondary task instead of waiting makes them slower. It also makes them forget the information in the e-mail task half of the time, which slows them down even more. CONCLUSION: When many cognitive resources are available, the probability of switching from one task to another is high. This does not necessarily lead to optimal switching behavior. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the minimization of delays in task design and the inability or discouragement of switching in high-workload moments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how strongly the performance of navigation tasks is affected by changing electronic map interfaces and by individual differences in spatial ability. BACKGROUND: Electronic map interfaces have two common configurations, north up and track up. Research suggests that north-up maps benefit some navigational tasks and track-up maps benefit others. However, little research has investigated how map configuration affects the important navigation task of judging cardinal direction or how individual differences in spatial ability interact with map configuration in affecting navigation performance. METHOD: In an aerial reconnaissance task, 16 participants completed route-following, cardinal direction, and map reconstruction tasks. Participants also completed three spatial ability tests. RESULTS: The track-up map led to better performance on the cardinal direction and route-following tasks. The north-up map led to better performance on the map reconstruction task Effects of map configuration showed small to medium effect sizes. Spatial ability correlated positively with performance of each navigation task, showing medium to large effect sizes. For some tasks, a helpful map interface compensated for low ability. For other tasks, ability facilitated the performance of the helpful interface;optimal performance required a helpful interface and high ability. CONCLUSION: Achieving high performance at particular navigation subtasks requires two things: using the map configuration that optimizes subtask performance and having high spatial ability. APPLICATION: Some aspects of navigation performance can be improved primarily by using the optimal map configuration; other aspects require using the optimal configuration and having better spatial ability.

{"abstract":"Tracking moving objects, including one's own body, is a fundamental ability of higher organisms, playing a central role in many perceptual and motor tasks. While it is unknown how the brain learns to follow and predict the dynamics of objects, it is known that this process of state estimation can be learned purely from the statistics of noisy observations. When the dynamics are simply linear with additive Gaussian noise, the optimal solution is the well known Kalman filter (KF), the parameters of which can be learned via latent-variable density estimation (the EM algorithm). The brain does not, however, directly manipulate matrices and vectors, but instead appears to represent probability distributions with the firing rates of population of neurons, \"probabilistic population codes.\" We show that a recurrent neural network-a modified form of an exponential family harmonium (EFH)-that takes a linear probabilistic population code as input can learn, without supervision, to estimate the state of a linear dynamical system. After observing a series of population responses (spike counts) to the position of a moving object, the network learns to represent the velocity of the object and forms nearly optimal predictions about the position at the next time-step. This result builds on our previous work showing that a similar network can learn to perform multisensory integration and coordinate transformations for static stimuli. The receptive fields of the trained network also make qualitative predictions about the developing and learning brain: tuning gradually emerges for higher-order dynamical states not explicitly present in the inputs, appearing as delayed tuning for the lower-order states.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A fully immersive, high-fidelity street-crossing simulator was used to examine the effects of texting on pedestrian street-crossing performance. BACKGROUND: Research suggests that street-crossing performance is impaired when pedestrians engage in cell phone conversations. Less is known about the impact of texting on street-crossing performance. METHOD: Thirty-two young adults completed three distraction conditions in a simulated street-crossing task: no distraction, phone conversation, and texting. A hands-free headset and a mounted tablet were used to conduct the phone and texting conversations, respectively. Participants moved through the virtual environment via a manual treadmill, allowing them to select crossing gaps and change their gait. RESULTS: During the phone conversation and texting conditions, participants had fewer successful crossings and took longer to initiate crossing. Furthermore, in the texting condition, smaller percentage of time with head orientation toward the tablet, fewer number of head orientations toward the tablet, and greater percentage of total characters typed before initiating crossing predicted greater crossing success. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that (a) texting is as unsafe as phone conversations for street-crossing performance and (b) when subjects completed most of the texting task before initiating crossing, they were more likely to make it safely across the street. APPLICATION: Sending and receiving text messages negatively impact a range of real-world behaviors. These results may inform personal and policy decisions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the architecture, integration requirements, and execution characteristics of a remote clinical decision support (CDS) service used in a multicenter clinical trial. The trial tested the efficacy of implementing brain injury prediction rules for children with minor blunt head trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated the Epic(\u00ae) electronic health record (EHR) with the Enterprise Clinical Rules Service (ECRS), a web-based CDS service, at two emergency departments. Patterns of CDS review included either a delayed, near-real-time review, where the physician viewed CDS recommendations generated by the nursing assessment, or a real-time review, where the physician viewed recommendations generated by their own documentation. A backstopping, vendor-based CDS triggered with zero delay when no recommendation was available in the EHR from the web-service. We assessed the execution characteristics of the integrated system and the source of the generated recommendations viewed by physicians. RESULTS: The ECRS mean execution time was 0.74 \u00b10.72s. Overall execution time was substantially different at the two sites, with mean total transaction times of 19.67 and 3.99s. Of 1930 analyzed transactions from the two sites, 60% (310\/521) of all physician documentation-initiated recommendations and 99% (1390\/1409) of all nurse documentation-initiated recommendations originated from the remote web service. DISCUSSION: The remote CDS system was the source of recommendations in more than half of the real-time cases and virtually all the near-real-time cases. Comparisons are limited by allowable variation in user workflow and resolution of the EHR clock. CONCLUSION: With maturation and adoption of standards for CDS services, remote CDS shows promise to decrease time-to-trial for multicenter evaluations of candidate decision support interventions.

{"abstract":"Estimating city evacuation time is a nontrivial problem due to the interaction between thousands of individual agents, giving rise to various collective phenomena, such as bottleneck formation, intermittent flow, and stop-and-go waves. We present a mean field approach to draw relationships between road network spatial attributes, the number of evacuees, and the resultant evacuation time estimate (ETE). Using volunteered geographic information, we divide 50 United Kingdom cities into a total of 704 catchment areas (CAs) which we define as an area where all agents share the same nearest exit node. 90% of the agents are within \u22486,847 m of CA exit nodes with \u224813,778 agents\/CA. We establish a characteristic flow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node, and exit node width) and a mean flow rate in a free-flow regime by simulating total evacuations using an agent based \"queuing network\" model. We use these variables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and resultant ETEs. This relationship could enable emergency planners to make a rapid appraisal of evacuation strategies and help support decisions in the run up to a crisis.

Assessment of an individual's risk of falling, facilitated by advanced movement sensing technologies, has been heralded as a potential means to target fall prevention interventions to those most at need. This paper presents the summary of a questionnaire-based survey of expert opinions collected from three major international conference meetings on the topic of fall risk assessment and fall prediction. Specifically, current problems are discussed, both in terms of technology as well as in study design, in order to harmonize and guide future research activities. The analysis of this survey confirms that sensor-based fall prediction is both relevant and promising, and that large-scale prospective studies are needed as well as further harmonization of research methods.

{"abstract":"4D film is an immersive entertainment system that presents various physical effects with a film in order to enhance viewers' experiences. Despite the recent emergence of 4D theaters, production of 4D effects relies on manual authoring. In this paper, we present algorithms that synthesize three classes of motion effects from the audiovisual content of a film. The first class of motion effects is those responding to fast camera motion to enhance the immersiveness of point-of-view shots, delivering fast and dynamic vestibular feedback. The second class moves viewers as closely as possible to the trajectory of slowly moving camera. Such motion provides an illusional effect of observing the scene from a distance while moving slowly within the scene. For these two classes, our algorithms compute the relative camera motion and then map it to a motion command to the 4D chair using appropriate motion mapping algorithms. The last class is for special effects, such as explosions, and our algorithm uses sound for the synthesis of impulses and vibrations. We assessed the subjective quality of our algorithms by user experiments, and results indicated that our algorithms can provide compelling motion effects.

{"abstract":"Every time an exceptional situation takes place on the road, dangerous situations occur and they need the drivers' skills in order to cope with them. These special situations can occur due to many reasons such as a non-expected object on the road, or an incoming emergency vehicle. Current proposals consider that vehicles are equipped with sensors and communication devices that collect and communicate sensor data to a central point to take further decisions. In this paper, those exceptional situations are handled in a different way: we propose to integrate an ontology inside each vehicle to provide them with distributed reasoning capabilities. Our system benefits traffic management in emergency situations with immediate and coherent suggestions to drivers where each vehicle is a decision point, reacts considering its neighboring vehicles, and collaborates with them to reach consensus in real time. A complete analysis of the system is given, from the behavior of the wireless link channel to the application level, giving an integral description of the designed solution. The system operates continuously adapting itself to driver reactions. A common ontology provides, during the reasoning process, a suggestion to each driver, maintaining the coherence of the whole set of suggestions (avoiding conflicting situations).

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discover how varying the length of task breaks would affect the time-on-task effect in subsequent testing periods. BACKGROUND: An important means of preventing errors and accidents caused by mental fatigue and time on task is to intersperse rest intervals within long work periods. Most studies of rest pauses to date have examined their effects in real-world tasks and settings, and their subtler effects on behavior, as measurable by laboratory paradigms, are not well understood. METHOD: We studied a group of 71 participants as they completed a 1-hr auditory oddball task with two rest opportunities. Rest intervals were 1, 5, or 10 min long. RESULTS: Improvements in reaction time were significantly positively associated with length of the rest break. However, longer breaks were also associated with steeper decrements in performance in the subsequent task block. Across individuals, the amount of immediate improvement correlated with the extent of later decline. CONCLUSION: Our results support a resource\/effort-allocation model of fatigue, whereby longer breaks bias participants toward greater effort expenditure on resumption of the task when cognitive resources may not have been fully replenished. APPLICATION: These findings may have implications for the refinement of work-rest schedules in industries where time-on-task degradation in performance is an important concern.

{"abstract":"Falls form a major health problem for older persons, and increasingly strain the healthcare system. The Internet is a potentially useful platform for empowering seniors. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the information-seeking behavior about falls among elderly Internet users. A web-based survey was distributed among all members of an association of elderly people (> 60 years old). Fallers and non-fallers, seniors with and without experience with information seeking and the willingness of elderly for undertaking self-assessment tests on the Internet versus solely receiving information about falls were compared. In general, there was much stated interest in receiving information about conditions and medications that increase the risk of falls and information on safety in the house. Around half of the 62 respondents did not feel that they are well-informed about falls. Searching for fall-related information was not significantly associated with having falls in the previous 12 months (OR 2.11, CI: 0.55-8.16).

{"abstract":"Fall events and their severe consequences represent not only a threatening problem for the affected individual, but also cause a significant burden for health care systems. Our research work aims to elucidate some of the prospects and problems of current sensor-based fall risk assessment approaches. Selected results of a questionnaire-based survey given to experts during topical workshops at international conferences are presented. The majority of domain experts confirmed that fall risk assessment could potentially be valuable for the community and that prediction is deemed possible, though limited. We conclude with a discussion of practical issues concerning adequate outcome parameters for clinical studies and data sharing within the research community. All participants agreed that sensor-based fall risk assessment is a promising and valuable approach, but that more prospective clinical studies with clearly defined outcome measures are necessary.

{"abstract":"Considerable work has demonstrated that inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior insula cortex (AIC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) are responsive during inhibitory control tasks. However, there is disagreement as to whether this relates to response selection\/ inhibition or attentional processing. The current study investigates this by using a Go\/No-go task with a factorial design. We observed that both left IFG and dorsal pre-SMA were responsive to no-go cues irrespective of cue frequency. This suggests a role for both in the inhibition of motor responses. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses suggest that inferior frontal gyrus may implement this function through interaction with basal ganglia and by suppressing the visual representation of cues associated with no-go responses. Anterior insula cortex and a more ventral portion of pre-SMA showed greater responsiveness to low frequency relative to higher frequency stimuli, irrespective of response type. This may reflect the hypothesized role of anterior insula cortex in marking low frequency items for additional processing (cf. Menon and Uddin, 2010). Consistent with this, the gPPI analysis revealed significantly greater anterior insula cortex connectivity with visual cortex in response to low relative to high frequency cues.

{"abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Pattern recognition analysis (PRA) applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to decode cognitive processes and identify possible biomarkers for mental illness. In the present study, we investigated whether the positive affect (PA) or negative affect (NA) personality traits could be decoded from patterns of brain activation in response to a human threat using a healthy sample. METHODS: fMRI data from 34 volunteers (15 women) were acquired during a simple motor task while the volunteers viewed a set of threat stimuli that were directed either toward them or away from them and matched neutral pictures. For each participant, contrast images from a General Linear Model (GLM) between the threat versus neutral stimuli defined the spatial patterns used as input to the regression model. We applied a multiple kernel learning (MKL) regression combining information from different brain regions hierarchically in a whole brain model to decode the NA and PA from patterns of brain activation in response to threat stimuli. RESULTS: The MKL model was able to decode NA but not PA from the contrast images between threat stimuli directed away versus neutral with a significance above chance. The correlation and the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual NA were 0.52 (p-value=0.01) and 24.43 (p-value=0.01), respectively. The MKL pattern regression model identified a network with 37 regions that contributed to the predictions. Some of the regions were related to perception (e.g., occipital and temporal regions) while others were related to emotional evaluation (e.g., caudate and prefrontal regions). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there was an interaction between the individuals' NA and the brain response to the threat stimuli directed away, which enabled the MKL model to decode NA from the brain patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PRA can be used to decode a personality trait from patterns of brain activation during emotional contexts.

{"abstract":"Mentoring in Medicine (MIM) addresses an urgent national need for minority health professionals and promotes careers in health care for urban youth. The MIM After School Program (ASP or The Course) has as its primary objectives to provide academic enrichment in human biology and motivate disadvantaged youth to pursue a career in the health professions. Secondary objectives of The Course, although not evaluated here, are to improve students' health literacy and knowledge of healthy living behaviors. Since 2009, over 1500 middle and high school students have completed the New York City based Course, which is offered once a week over a 10 week semester in an out-of-school venue. This study assesses the success of The Course in achieving its primary objectives with 84 students at five New York City high schools during the fall 2014 semester. The Course curriculum was created especially for MIM, comprises the body's 11 organ systems, and is presented in discrete modules (one each semester), along with complementary educational activities, including field trips and class projects. This study reports on a formal evaluation using quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative evaluation found that the students significantly increased their knowledge of the Gastrointestinal System. Students across the academic spectrum appeared to have learned the MIM ASP Course content - high school GPA was not a predictor of knowledge acquisition. The students also reported that The Course significantly increased their self-confidence in their ability to succeed (self-efficacy). The students expressed a significant increase in five health care related attitudes and an additional increase in their ability to overcome personal issues to succeed in their career and significantly improving their feeling toward, and likely pursuit of, a health career. The students stated that The Course significantly increased their interest and intent to seek out more information about health care, participate in health care activities, and take more health care courses in high school. The qualitative evaluation found that the students and their parents were pleased with the MIM ASP Course's composition, presentation, and effectiveness. With a large majority of the parents stating that their child got out of The Course what they had hoped for and that The Course made it more likely that they would recommend a health career for their child. The students and instructional staff also identified The Course elements that they felt were most and least effective. Best practices that were used in designing and conducting The Course were identified. The MIM ASP Course appears to have achieved its principal educational objectives of providing academic enrichment in human biology and improving attitudes towards a health career for a self-selected population of disadvantaged, underrepresented minority high school students in an urban setting.

In the present study postural control was examined in healthy elderly and young subjects during a task in which subjects had to move the body's center of mass towards a virtual target on a screen that appeared at predictable and unpredictable locations. Postural control decreased with unpredictable targets, e.g. movement time was larger, trajectories more irregular. The results indicate that even though older individuals clearly benefitted from the early release of target location information, young individuals improved even more when target information became available.This indicates thatthe young were better able to use this information prospectively for executing the target directed movement quickly and accurately.

In this study twelve healthy older and younger subjects performed anterior-posterior or mediolateral oscillations on a wobble board, in three conditions: no feedback, real-time visual feedback, and real-time visual feedback with a competitive game element. The Elderly moved slower, less accurately and more irregularly than younger people. Both feedback conditions ensured a more controlled movement technique on the wobble-board and increased experienced workout intensity. The participants enjoyed the attention demanding competitive game element, but this game did not improve balance performance more than interacting with a game that incorporated visual feedback.

{"abstract":"Death, injury and disability from road traffic crashes continue to be a major global public health problem. Recent data suggest that the number of fatalities from traffic crashes is in excess of 1.25 million people each year with non-fatal injuries affecting a further 20-50 million people. It is predicted that by 2030 road traffic accidents will have progressed to be the 5th leading cause of death and that the number of people who will die annually from traffic accidents will have doubled from current levels. Therefore, methods to reduce accident severity are of great interest to traffic agencies and the public at large. Road accident fatality rate depends on many factors and it is a very challenging task to investigate the dependencies between the attributes because of the many environmental and road accident factors. Any missing data in the database could obscure the discovery of important factors and lead to invalid conclusions. In order to make the traffic accident datasets useful for analysis, it should be preprocessed properly. In this paper, we present a novel method based on sampling of distributions obtained from correlation measures for the imputation of missing values to improve the quality of the traffic accident data. We evaluated our algorithm using two publicly available traffic accident databases of United States (explore.data.gov, data. opencolorado.org). Our results indicate that the proposed method performs significantly better than the three existing algorithms.

In this paper, we present a prediction framework that utilizes the MPGD to construct an accumulated histograms-based representation of an ongoing human activity. The accumulated histograms of MPGDs are then used to train a set of support-vector-machine classifiers with a probabilistic output to predict fall in an ongoing human activity.

{"abstract":"Stress resilience is mediated, in part, by our ability to predict and control threats within our environment. Therefore, determining the neural mechanisms that regulate the emotional response to predictable and controllable threat may provide important new insight into the processes that mediate resilience to emotional dysfunction and guide the future development of interventions for anxiety disorders. To better understand the effect of predictability and controllability on threat-related brain activity in humans, two groups of healthy volunteers participated in a yoked Pavlovian fear conditioning study during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Threat predictability was manipulated by presenting an aversive unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was either preceded by a conditioned stimulus (i.e., predictable) or by presenting the UCS alone (i.e., unpredictable). Similar to animal model research that has employed yoked fear conditioning procedures, one group (Controllable Condition; CC), but not the other group (Uncontrollable Condition; UC) was able to terminate the UCS. The fMRI signal response within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and posterior cingulate was diminished during predictable compared to unpredictable threat (i.e., UCS). In addition, threat-related activity within the ventromedial PFC and bilateral hippocampus was diminished only to threats that were both predictable and controllable. These findings provide insight into how threat predictability and controllability affects the activity of brain regions (i.e., ventromedial PFC and hippocampus) involved in emotion regulation, and may have important implications for better understanding neural processes that mediate emotional resilience to stress.

{"abstract":"Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is a complication of intubated trauma patients and a leading cause in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality. Since early diagnosis, by specimen culture takes days to complete, an overuse of broad spectrum antibiotics is the usual treatment. As a result there is the risk of developing antibiotic resistant strains. Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) derived model to predict those at risk would result in reduced risk of resistant strains, a lowering of mortality rates and considerable savings in treatment costs. Artificial Neural Networks work well on classification problems, using feed-forward\/back propagation methodology. Using the National Trauma Data Bank (V6.2) data files, Tiberius Software created the ANN models. Best models were identified by their Gini co-efficient, ability to predict the complication outcome selected, and their RMSE scores. The model ensemble for the complications recorded in the registry were determined, variables ranked and model accuracy recorded. RESULTS show an effective model, able to predict to 85% of those likely to contract VAP and similar figures for those unlikely to contract VAP. This equates to 1 in 10 patients being missed, and 1 in 10 falsely being flagged for treatment. Important variables in model development are not related to physiological factors, but injury status and the treatment received (intubation and expected ICU stay more than 2 days). Application of a predictive model could reduce the number of false positives being treated in an ICU and identify those most at risk, thereby lowering treatment costs and potentially helping improve mortality rates.

Over this 10 year period, ECC-Crete gradually employed advanced medical technologies and electronic protocol-based handling in all phases of an emergency episode contributing to its timely and effective management. GIS\/GPS technology and telemetry for biosignals in ambulances, up-to-date triage protocols combined with incidence analysis provide vital information for continuous process improvement. In 2000-2006, process improvement due to technological and organizational changes has led to increased efficiency. The mean reduction was ~75% in dispatch time, ~50% in the time at accident scene for metropolitan areas, and ~75% in time at the emergency ward, mainly due to medical interventions on site.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether losses of inhibitory control could be responsible for some friendly-fire incidents. BACKGROUND: Several factors are commonly cited to explain friendly-fire incidents, but failure of inhibitory control has not yet been explored. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) could be a valid model for inhibition failures in some combat scenarios. METHOD: Participants completed small-arms simulations using near infrared emitter guns, confronting research assistants acting as friends or foes. In Experiment 1, seven participants completed three conditions with three different proportions of foes (high, medium, low). In Experiment 2, 13 participants completed high-foe (high-go) and low-foe (low-go) versions of a small-arms simulation as well as comparative computer tasks. RESULTS: Participants made more friendly-fire errors (errors of commission) when foe proportion was high. A speed-accuracy trade-off was apparent, with participants who were faster to fire on foes also more likely to accidentally shoot friends. When foe proportion was higher, response times to foe stimuli were faster, and subjective workload ratings were higher. CONCLUSION: Failures of inhibitory control may be responsible for some friendly-fire incidents and the SART could be a suitable empirical model for some battlefield environments. The effect appears to be disproportionately greater at higher foe proportions. The exact nature of performance reductions associated with high-foe proportions requires further investigation. APPLICATION: The SART may be a useful model of friendly-fire scenarios. It could be used to indicate a soldier's likelihood to commit a friendly-fire mistake and to identify high-risk environments.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this paper I begin looking for evidence of a subjective workload curve. BACKGROUND: Results from subjective mental workload assessments are often interpreted linearly. However, I hypothesized that ratings of subjective mental workload increase nonlinearly with unitary increases in working memory load. METHOD: Two studies were conducted. In the first, the participant provided ratings of the mental difficulty of a series of digit span recall tasks. In the second study, participants provided ratings of mental difficulty associated with recall of visual patterns. The results of the second study were then examined using a mathematical model of working memory. RESULTS: An S curve, predicted a priori, was found in the results of both the digit span and visual pattern studies. A mathematical model showed a tight fit between workload ratings and levels of working memory activation. CONCLUSION: This effort provides good initial evidence for the existence of a workload curve. The results support further study in applied settings and other facets of workload (e.g., temporal workload). APPLICATION: Measures of subjective workload are used across a wide variety of domains and applications. These results bear on their interpretation, particularly as they relate to workload thresholds.

{"abstract":"A research-action program was established in 1996 between the Loos-Lez-Lille prison psychiatric unit and the Department of Medical Informatics of the University Hospital of Lille (France):--(1) to investigate the health status and the general characteristics of the prison population--(2) to develop an Information System for improving the prison health care and to facilitate social rehabilitation of convicts. Starting off 1988, all new prisoners are interviewed on their arrival using a standard questionnaire. The transfer of all the information recorded in this questionnaire into a computer base was initiated in 1996, when the research action program began. A statistical analysis was performed on 15,200 records (1989-1995) to identify the most informative parameters: 50% of inmates were less than 24 years old; 57% were unemployed; 60% had no professional qualification. 31% of inmates had a psychiatric history and 16% had made a previous suicide attempt. The rate of drug abuse has increased from 24% in 89 to 53% in 95. To analyze the time trends of these parameters, a prototype of Information System was then developed. The system uses the database to product standard reports in real time. Language: en","authors":["Alain Duhamel","Eric A. Archer","Patrick Devos","Nuttens Mc","R.

{"abstract":"We used the (14)C-deoxyglucose method to reveal changes in activity, in the lateral sulcus of monkeys, elicited by reaching-to-grasp in the light or in the dark and by observation of the same action executed by an external agent. Both visually-guided execution and observation of the same action activated the secondary somatosensory cortex, the ventral somatosensory area, the somatorecipient parietal ventral area, the retroinsula and the caudo-medial area of the auditory belt. These matching activations indicate that the somesthetic consequences of movements, generated bottom-up during action execution, may also be triggered top-down during action observation to represent the predicted sensory consequences of the perceived movement. The posterior granular part of insula found to be activated only for action execution and its anterior agranular part activated only for action observation may contribute to the attribution of action to the correct agent. Also, execution in the dark implicated all components activated by execution in the light but the retroinsula. In conclusion, activation of the somatorecipient parietal areas, not only for action-execution but also for action-observation, indicates that perception of actions performed by an external agent presupposes knowledge about the action-effect relationships, and that understanding others' actions consists of running off-line previously stored sensory-motor programs.

{"abstract":"The expansion of offshore oil exploitation into remote areas (e.g., Arctic) with harsh environments has significantly increased occupational risks. Among occupational accidents, slips, trips and falls from height (STFs) account for a significant portion. Thus, a dynamic risk assessment of the three main occupational accidents is meaningful to decrease offshore occupational risks. Bow-tie Models (BTs) were established in this study for the risk analysis of STFs considering extreme environmental factors. To relax the limitations of BTs, Bayesian networks (BNs) were developed based on BTs to dynamically assess risks of STFs. The occurrence and consequence probabilities of STFs were respectively calculated using BTs and BNs, and the obtained probabilities verified BNs\u05f3 rationality and advantage. Furthermore, the probability adaptation for STFs was accomplished in a specific scenario with BNs. Finally, posterior probabilities of basic events were achieved through diagnostic analysis, and critical basic events were analyzed based on their posterior likelihood to cause occupational accidents. The highlight is systematically analyzing STF accidents for offshore operations and dynamically assessing their risks considering the harsh environmental factors. This study can guide the allocation of prevention resources and benefit the safety management of offshore operations.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to examine the extent to which interruptions negatively impact situation awareness and long-term performance in a submarine track management task where pre- and postinterruption display scenes remained essentially identical. BACKGROUND: Interruptions in command and control task environments can degrade performance well beyond the first postinterruption action typically measured for sequential static tasks, because individuals need to recover their situation awareness for multiple unfolding display events. Participants in the current study returned to an unchanged display scene following interruption and therefore could be more immune to such long-term performance deficits. METHOD: The task required participants to monitor a display to detect contact heading changes and to make enemy engagement decisions. Situation awareness (Situation Present Assessment Method) and subjective workload (NASA-Task Load Index) were measured. The interruption replaced the display for 20 s with a blank screen, during which participants completed a classification task. RESULTS: Situation awareness after returning from interruption was degraded. Participants were slower to make correct engagement decisions and slower and less accurate in detecting heading changes, despite these task decisions being made at least 40 s following the interruption. CONCLUSION: Interruptions negatively impacted situation awareness and long-term performance because participants needed to redetermine the location and spatial relationship between the displayed contacts when returning from interruption, either because their situation awareness for the preinterruption scene decayed or because they did not encode the preinterruption scene. APPLICATION: Interruption in work contexts such as submarines is unavoidable, and further understanding of how operators are affected is required to improve work design and training.

{"abstract":"The current study examined the rate and psychiatric correlates of sexual abuse involving the use of digital technologies by the offender in a wide sample of juvenile victims. Sociodemographic, abuse, and psychiatric characteristics of 662 sexually abused children and adolescents were evaluated. Of these, 93 reported that digital devices were used by the offender in several ways to facilitate the sexual abuse. The offender-victim relationship was initiated through the Internet in 39 victims. Involvement of digital technologies in sexual abuse was significantly associated with penetrative and recurrent form of sexual abuse commited by multiple offenders with coexisting violence. Additionally, victims of sexual abuse with a digital component were 4.21 times more likely to develop any psychopathology, 3.77 times more likely to have depression, and 2.14 times more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of sexual abuse. These results indicated that the offender's use of digital technology may aid the initiation and facilitaion of the sexual abuse of youths and may relate to more severe outcomes. This study revealed the importance of raising the awareness of professionals and the community about the potential risks associated with digital technologies and sexual abuse. Mental health professionals should consider this additional form of victimization, especially when dealing with sexual abuse victims.

{"abstract":"This paper presents an ongoing project targeting mobility support for users of public transportation including people with limited mobility. Existing approaches in this field mostly offer non-continuous guidance during the whole journey including multiple rides with different vehicles and footpaths in between at transfer points. Especially people with limited mobility, like people with disabilities and elderly people, or travelers who are not familiar with the specific route or transfer point, like tourists, often struggle with public transportation. They crave for a seamless approach covering all links of the mobility chain - the sequence of sections of the whole route - and providing comprehensive assistance throughout the whole journey. Previous projects and widespread experiences of project partners revealed that especially footpath sections are lacking proper support. In particular, the consortium identified three problem areas in existing approaches when dealing with footpath sections: (1) A lack of information, (2) a lack of orientation and (3) a lack of provision of services. In order to bridge (lat. PONS) these gaps in the mobility chain, new paradigms and technology concepts are developed to tackle the shortcomings on footpaths and combined in a toolkit to help developers of applications with focus on pedestrian navigation and public transport to improve their solutions with sustainable and state-of-the-art approaches.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated how increases in task-relevant information affect human decision-making performance, situation awareness (SA), and trust in a simulated command-and-control (C2) environment. BACKGROUND: Increased information is often associated with an improvement of SA and decision-making performance in networked organizations. However, previous research suggests that increasing information without considering the task relevance and the presentation can impair performance. METHOD: We used a simulated C2 task across two experiments. Experiment 1 varied the information volume provided to individual participants and measured the speed and accuracy of decision making for task performance. Experiment 2 varied information volume and information reliability provided to two participants acting in different roles and assessed decision-making performance, SA, and trust between the paired participants. RESULTS: In both experiments, increased task-relevant information volume did not improve task performance. In Experiment 2, increased task-relevant information volume reduced self-reported SA and trust, and incorrect source reliability information led to poorer task performance and SA. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that increasing the volume of information, even when it is accurate and task relevant, is not necessarily beneficial to decision-making performance. Moreover, it may even be detrimental to SA and trust among team members. APPLICATION: Given the high volume of available and shared information and the safety-critical and time-sensitive nature of many decisions, these results have implications for training and system design in C2 domains. To avoid decrements to SA, interpersonal trust, and decision-making performance, information presentation within C2 systems must reflect human cognitive processing limits and capabilities.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previously published statistical models of driving posture have been effective for vehicle design but have not taken into account the effects of age. OBJECTIVE: The present study developed new statistical models for predicting driving posture. METHODS: Driving postures of 90 U.S. drivers with a wide range of age and body size were measured in laboratory mockup in nine package conditions. Posture-prediction models for female and male drivers were separately developed by employing a stepwise regression technique using age, body dimensions, vehicle package conditions, and two-way interactions, among other variables. RESULTS: Driving posture was significantly associated with age, and the effects of other variables depended on age. A set of posture-prediction models is presented for women and men. The results are compared with a previously developed model. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first study of driver posture to include a large cohort of older drivers and the first to report a significant effect of age.

{"abstract":"A vertical slope of sidewalks significantly inhibits to the mobility of manual wheelchair users in their daily life. International guidelines of the vertical slope are specified approximately 4% or 5% (1:20) gradient or less as preferred, and allow 8.3% (1:12) as its maximum when it is impossible. Relevant research of the physical strain for wheelchair users with pushing on slopes, and the validity assessment of slope guidelines have been investigated. However, the analysis for the effect of a slope distance and their transient performance are still remained. The purpose of this study is to clarify the physiological and biomechanical characteristics of manual wheelchair users that propelling a wheelchair on an uphill slope. We measured these data by a metabolic analysis system, a heart rate monitor system and an instrumented wheelchair wheel. Sixteen unimpaired subjects (non-wheelchair users) were examined to investigate the effect of a long slope with 120m distance and 8% gradient. And five wheelchair users with cervical cord injury were examined to evaluate the influence of different gradients (5%, 6.7%, 8.3%, 10% and 12.5%) with 3m length in laboratory. Our experimental results of the long slope showed that wheelchair propulsion velocity and power increased considerably at the beginning of the slope where the peak mean value of them were 0.96 m\/s and 70.8W and they decreased linearly to 0.55m\/s and 33.6W at final interval. A mean oxygen uptake and heart rate were increased as the distance increased and their results indicated the extremely high exercise intensity at a final interval that were 1.2liter \/min and 152bpm. While wheelchair pushing cadence reduced after an initial interval, mean of strokes per10m increased to compensate the decrease of upper limb's power. The results of different gradients indicated that the normalized power of subjects with cervical cord injury was significant difference between each subject in the ability to climb a slope. Mean normalized power were 0.23W\/kg on a 5% slope, 0.24W\/kg on 6.7%, and 0.26W\/kg on 8.3% respectively. Based on these findings, we examined the relationship between the theoretical normalized power and the lowest velocity to climb a slope, and we might indicate the ability to push on an uphill slope for the persons with manual wheelchair user.

{"abstract":"Falls are the most-common causes of unintentional injury and death in older adults. Many clinics, hospitals, and health-care providers are urgently seeking accurate, low-cost, and easy-to-use technology to predict falls before they happen, e.g., by monitoring the human walking pattern (or \"gait\"). Despite the wide popularity of Microsoft's Kinect and the plethora of solutions for gait monitoring, no strategy has been proposed to date to allow non-expert users to calibrate the cameras, which is essential to accurately fuse the body motion observed by each camera in a single frame of reference. In this paper, we present a novel multi-Kinect calibration algorithm that has advanced features when compared to existing methods: 1) is easy to use, 2) it can be used in any generic Kinect arrangement, and 3) it provides accurate calibration. Extensive real-world experiments have been conducted to validate our algorithm and to compare its performance against other multi-Kinect calibration approaches, especially to show the improved estimate of gait parameters. Finally, a MATLAB Toolbox has been made publicly available for the entire research community.

{"abstract":"Falling asleep during driving is a serious problem that has resulted in fatal accidents worldwide. Thus, there is a need to detect driver drowsiness to counter it. This study analyzes the changes in the electroencephalography (EEG) collected from 4 subjects driving under monotonous road conditions using a driving simulator. The drowsiness level of the subjects is inferred from the time taken to react to events. The results from the analysis of the reaction time shows that drowsiness occurs in cycles, which correspond to short sleep cycles known as 'microsleeps'. The results from a time-frequency analysis of the four frequency bands' power reveals differences between trials with fast and slow reaction times; greater beta band power is present in all subjects, greater alpha power in 2 subjects, greater theta power in 2 subjects, and greater delta power in 3 subjects, for fast reaction trials.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the crossing behavior of straight-moving drivers when they encounter other straight-moving drivers at unsignalized intersections in China. BACKGROUND: In China, when two vehicle drivers encounter at an unsignalized intersection, neither driver completely stops his or her vehicle in most cases. Instead, one driver gradually approaches the intersection and dynamically decides to either yield or preempt by gaming with the other vehicle. This process increases the probability of accidents. METHOD: A total of 305 crossing cases were collected at an unsignalized intersection in Kunming City. Motion parameters were extracted from the video detection program designed by our research group. Based on a logistic regression method, we analyzed decision making moment of straight-moving drivers under crossing conditions, established crossing behavior models, and identified the main factors that affected drivers' decisions. In all, 68 cases observed at a separate intersection were used to validate the established models. RESULTS: For crossing processes at unsignalized intersections in China, straight-moving drivers from the right side completed preemptive\/yielding decisions at 1.3 s before reaching the crossing point. However, the majority of straight-moving drivers from the left side completed decisions at 1.1 s before reaching the crossing point. The most important parameter that influenced the drivers' decisions was the difference between the speeds of the two vehicles. CONCLUSION: An effective method for preventing traffic conflict between two straight-moving drivers is to control the speeds of the vehicles before they enter the intersection. APPLICATION: This study explores crossing behavior of straight-moving drivers and provides significant insights for controlling driver behavior.

{"abstract":"Serious games (exergames) have the potential to be effective for postural balance and increasing muscle strength. Several games have been developed to increase physical fitness and balance among older adults. However, it is unclear to which degree usability and acceptability of exergames for older adults have been evaluated. The aim of this study was to summarize usability evaluation and acceptability of studies in older adults. We conducted a scoping review on studies focusing on usability of exergames for older adults. The result shows that older adults consider usability and acceptability of exercise video games good. The review shows that longitudinal studies mainly use off-the-shelf exergame and evaluated game effectiveness and acceptability, whereas cross-sectional studies focus on interactional experience. Studies varied in their approaches to measure usability and acceptability of exergames for older adults. There is a need for a systematic developmental approach to involve older adults in development of exergames for longitudinal studies.

{"abstract":"We describe the methodology and impact of merging detailed statewide mortality data into the master patient index tables of the clinical data repository (CDR) of the University of Virginia Health System (UVAHS). We employ three broadly inclusive linkage passes (designed to result in large numbers of false positives) to match the patients in the CDR to those in the statewide files using the following criteria: a) Social Security Number; b) Patient Last Name and Birth Date; c) Patient Last Name and Patient First Name. The results from these initial matches are refined by calculation and assignment of a total score comprised of partial scores depending on the quality of matching between the various identifiers. In order to validate our scoring algorithm, we used those patients known to have died at UVAHS over the eight year period as an internal control. We conclude that we are able to update our CDR with 97% of the deaths from the state source using this scheme. We illustrate the potential of the resulting system to assist caregivers in identification of at-risk patient groups by description of those patients in the CDR who were found to have committed suicide. We suggest that our approach represents an efficient and inexpensive way to enrich hospital data with important outcomes information. Language: en","authors":["Robert D. Pates","Kenneth W.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We studied the utility of occlusion distance as a function of task-relevant event density in realistic traffic scenarios with self-controlled speed. BACKGROUND: The visual occlusion technique is an established method for assessing visual demands of driving. However, occlusion time is not a highly informative measure of environmental task-relevant event density in self-paced driving scenarios because it partials out the effects of changes in driving speed. METHOD: Self-determined occlusion times and distances of 97 drivers with varying backgrounds were analyzed in driving scenarios simulating real Finnish suburban and highway traffic environments with self-determined vehicle speed. RESULTS: Occlusion distances varied systematically with the expected environmental demands of the manipulated driving scenarios whereas the distributions of occlusion times remained more static across the scenarios. Systematic individual differences in the preferred occlusion distances were observed. More experienced drivers achieved better lane-keeping accuracy than inexperienced drivers with similar occlusion distances; however, driving experience was unexpectedly not a major factor for the preferred occlusion distances. CONCLUSION: Occlusion distance seems to be an informative measure for assessing task-relevant event density in realistic traffic scenarios with self-controlled speed. Occlusion time measures the visual demand of driving as the task-relevant event rate in time intervals, whereas occlusion distance measures the experienced task-relevant event density in distance intervals. APPLICATION: The findings can be utilized in context-aware distraction mitigation systems, human-automated vehicle interaction, road speed prediction and design, as well as in the testing of visual in-vehicle tasks for inappropriate in-vehicle glancing behaviors in any dynamic traffic scenario for which appropriate individual occlusion distances can be defined.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A proof-of-concept analysis was conducted to establish whether link analysis could be applied to data from on-train recorders to detect patterns of behavior that could act as leading indicators of potential safety issues. BACKGROUND: On-train data recorders capture data about driving behavior on thousands of routine journeys every day and offer a source of untapped data that could be used to offer insights into human behavior. METHOD: Data from 17 journeys undertaken by six drivers on the same route over a 16-hr period were analyzed using link analysis, and four key metrics were examined: number of links, network density, diameter, and sociometric status. RESULTS: The results established that link analysis can be usefully applied to data captured from on-vehicle recorders. The four metrics revealed key differences in normal driver behavior. These differences have promising construct validity as leading indicators. CONCLUSION: Link analysis is one method that could be usefully applied to exploit data routinely gathered by on-vehicle data recorders. It facilitates a proactive approach to safety based on leading indicators, offers a clearer understanding of what constitutes normal driving behavior, and identifies trends at the interface of people and systems, which is currently a key area of strategic risk. APPLICATION: These research findings have direct applications in the field of transport data monitoring. They offer a means of automatically detecting patterns in driver behavior that could act as leading indicators of problems during operation and that could be used in the proactive monitoring of driver competence, risk management, and even infrastructure design.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of secondary tasks on the driving performance of individuals with mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). BACKGROUND: Studies suggest detrimental impacts of driving with TBI or while distracted but the impact of driver distraction on TBI drivers is not well documented. METHOD: Bayesian regression models were used to estimate the effect of relatively simple secondary tasks on driving performance of TBI and healthy control (HC) drivers. A driving simulator was used to develop prior distribution of task effects on driving performance for HCs. An on-road study was conducted with TBI and HC drivers to generate effect estimates for the posterior distributions. The Bayesian models were also compared to frequentist models. RESULTS: During a coin-sorting task, all drivers exhibited larger maximum lateral acceleration and larger standard deviation of speed than in a baseline driving segment. There were no significant driving performance differences between the TBI and the HC drivers during the tasks. Across all tasks, TBI drivers spent more time looking at the tasks and made more frequent glances toward the tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that even drivers with mild TBI have significantly longer and more glances toward the tasks compared to the HCs. APPLICATION: This study demonstrates a Bayesian approach and how the results differ from frequentist statistics. Using prior distributions in a Bayesian model helps account for the probabilities associated with otherwise unknown parameters. This method strengthens the Bayesian parameter estimates compared to that of a frequentist model. Keywords: Driver distraction; Language: en","authors":["David M. Neyens","Linda Ng Boyle","Maria T.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Auditory displays could be essential to helping drivers maintain situation awareness in autonomous vehicles, but to date, few or no studies have examined the effectiveness of different types of auditory displays for this application scenario. BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the development of autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving cars) have suggested that widespread automation of driving may be tenable in the near future. Drivers may be required to monitor the status of automation programs and vehicle conditions as they engage in secondary leisure or work tasks (entertainment, communication, etc.) in autonomous vehicles. METHOD: An experiment compared memory for alerted events-a component of Level 1 situation awareness-using speech alerts, auditory icons, and a visual control condition during a video-simulated self-driving car ride with a visual secondary task. The alerts gave information about the vehicle's operating status and the driving scenario. RESULTS: Speech alerts resulted in better memory for alerted events. Both auditory display types resulted in less perceived effort devoted toward the study tasks but also greater perceived annoyance with the alerts. CONCLUSION: Speech auditory displays promoted Level 1 situation awareness during a simulation of a ride in a self-driving vehicle under routine conditions, but annoyance remains a concern with auditory displays. APPLICATION: Speech auditory displays showed promise as a means of increasing Level 1 situation awareness of routine scenarios during an autonomous vehicle ride with an unrelated secondary task.

{"abstract":"Social networks have well documented effects at the individual and aggregate level. Consequently it is often useful to understand how an attempt to influence a network will change its structure and consequently achieve other goals. We develop a framework for network modification that allows for arbitrary objective functions, types of modification (e.g. edge weight addition, edge weight removal, node removal, and covariate value change), and recovery mechanisms (i.e. how a network responds to interventions). The framework outlined in this paper helps both to situate the existing work on network interventions but also opens up many new possibilities for intervening in networks. In particular use two case studies to highlight the potential impact of empirically calibrating the objective function and network recovery mechanisms as well as showing how interventions beyond node removal can be optimised. First, we simulate an optimal removal of nodes from the Noordin terrorist network in order to reduce the expected number of attacks (based on empirically predicting the terrorist collaboration network from multiple types of network ties). Second, we simulate optimally strengthening ties within entrepreneurial ecosystems in six developing countries. In both cases we estimate ERGM models to simulate how a network will endogenously evolve after intervention.

In this project, we present a system and algorithms for recognizing pedestrian crossings in outdoor environments. Our goal is to provide navigation cues for crossing the street and reaching an island or sidewalk safely. Using a state-of-the-art Multisense S7S sensor, we collected 3D pointcloud data for real-time detection of pedestrian crossing and generation of directional guidance. We demonstrate improvements to a baseline, monocular-camera-based system by integrating 3D spatial prior information extracted from the pointcloud. Our system's parameters can be set to the actual dimensions of real-world settings, which enables robustness of occlusion and perspective transformation. The system works especially well in non-occlusion situations, and is reasonably accurate under different kind of conditions.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: An experiment was performed in a driving simulator to investigate the impacts of practice, trust, and interaction on manual control recovery (MCR) when employing fully automated driving (FAD). BACKGROUND: To increase the use of partially or highly automated driving efficiency and to improve safety, some studies have addressed trust in driving automation and training, but few studies have focused on FAD. FAD is an autonomous system that has full control of a vehicle without any need for intervention by the driver. METHOD: A total of 69 drivers with a valid license practiced with FAD. They were distributed evenly across two conditions: simple practice and elaborate practice. RESULTS: When examining emergency MCR, a correlation was found between trust and reaction time in the simple practice group (i.e., higher trust meant a longer reaction time), but not in the elaborate practice group. This result indicated that to mitigate the negative impact of overtrust on reaction time, more appropriate practice may be needed. CONCLUSIONS: Drivers should be trained in how the automated device works so as to improve MCR performance in case of an emergency.

{"abstract":"Social evaluation is a ubiquitous feature of daily interpersonal interactions and can produce strong positive or negative emotional reactions. While previous research has highlighted neural correlates of static or dynamic facial expressions, little is known about neural processing of more naturalistic social interaction simulations or the modulating role of inter-individual differences such as trait fear of negative\/positive evaluation. The present fMRI study investigated neural activity of 37 (21 female) healthy participants while watching videos of posers expressing a range of positive, negative, and neutral statements tapping into several basic and social emotions. Unpleasantness ratings linearly increased in response to positive to neutral to negative videos whereas arousal ratings were elevated in both emotional video conditions. At the whole brain level, medial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activated strongly in both emotional conditions which may be attributed to the cognitive processing demands of responding to complex social evaluation. Region of interest analysis for basic emotion processing areas revealed enhanced amygdala activation in both emotional conditions, whereas anterior and posterior insula showed stronger activity during negative evaluations only. Individuals with high fear of positive evaluation were characterized by increased posterior insula activity during positive videos, suggesting heightened interoception. Taken together, these results replicate and extend studies that used facial expression stimuli and reveal neurobiological systems involved in processing of more complex social-evaluative videos. RESULTS also point to vulnerability factors for social-interaction related psychopathologies. Language: en","authors":["Stephan F.

We show analytically that the non-model-based PD controller provides locally asymptotically stable set-point regulation, and we show analytically that the model-based controllers provide locally asymptotically stable 6-DOF trajectory tracking. Numerical simulation studies are reported that corroborate the analytical stability results. We report the first comparative experimental evaluation of three different control algorithms for dynamic 6-DOF trajectory tracking of fully actuated underwater vehicles. Experimental results with the Johns Hopkins University remotely operated vehicle (JHU ROV) show that the model-based controllers' mean absolute position and velocity tracking error is significantly smaller than the non-model-based PD controller for coupled maneuvers. The model-based controllers are shown to outperform the non-model-based controllers over a wide range of variations in the magnitude of derivative feedback gain. The velocity tracking error of the model-based controllers is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as the measurement error of the velocity sensing instrumentation.

{"abstract":"More than thirty percent of persons over 65 years fall at least once a year and are often not able to get up again. The lack of timely aid after such a fall incident can lead to severe complications. This timely aid can however be assured by a camera-based fall detection system triggering an alarm when a fall occurs. Most algorithms described in literature use the biggest object detected using background subtraction to extract the fall features. In this paper we compare the performance of our state-of-the-art fall detection algorithm when using only background subtraction, when using a particle filter to track the person and a hybrid method in which the particle filter is only used to enhance the background subtraction and not for the feature extraction. We tested this using our simulation data set containing reenactments of real-life falls. This comparison shows that this hybrid method significantly increases the sensitivity and robustness of the fall detection algorithm resulting in a sensitivity of 76.1% and a PPV of 41.2%.

{"abstract":"Falls represent one of the most common causes of injury-related morbidity and mortality in later life. Subjects with cardiovascular disorders (e.g., related to autonomic dysfunctions and postural hypotension) are at higher risk of falling. Autonomic dysfunctions increasing the risk of falling in the short and mid-term could be assessed by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) extracted by electrocardiograph (ECG). We developed three trials for assessing the usefulness of ECG monitoring using wearable devices for: risk assessment of falling in the next few weeks; prevention of imminent falls due to standing hypotension; and fall detection. Statistical and data-mining methods are adopted to develop classification and regression models, validated with the cross-validation approach. The first classifier based on HRV features enabled to identify future fallers among hypertensive patients with an accuracy of 72% (sensitivity: 51.1%, specificity: 80.2%). The regression model to predict falls due to orthostatic dropdown from HRV recorded before standing achieved an overall accuracy of 80% (sensitivity: 92%, specificity: 90%). Finally, the classifier to detect simulated falls using ECG achieved an accuracy of 77.3% (sensitivity: 81.8%, specificity: 72.7%). The evidence from these three studies showed that ECG monitoring and processing could achieve satisfactory performances compared to other system for risk assessment, fall prevention and detection. This is interesting as differently from other technologies actually employed to prevent falls, ECG is recommended for many other pathologies of later life and is more accepted by senior citizens.

{"abstract":"This paper presents an initial overview of insights gained into how older adults mobilize in the home and community, based on data from inertial sensors which were worn by study participants over a 7-day period. The addition of a wearable camera provided additional contextual information which can be used to assess mobility and understand the factors that influence it in the free living environment. Seven days of data collected from a group of older adults who had experienced one or more falls in the previous six months was compared to that of a control group with no history of falling. RESULTS showed that both groups spent relatively little time walking in challenging environmental conditions, and that the fallers spent significantly less time walking under regular conditions (no effect on gait) and outdoors. Analysis of gait metrics showed that the fallers were slightly slower in general, and more noticeable differences were observed when the participants were regrouped according to mobility levels determined from baseline assessments using traditional methods.

{"abstract":"Falling is a serious problem in an aged society such that assessment of the risk of falls for individuals is imperative for the research and practice of falls prevention. This paper introduces an application of several machine learning methods for training a classifier which is capable of classifying individual older adults into a high risk group and a low risk group (distinguished by whether or not the members of the group have a recent history of falls). Using a 3D motion capture system, significant gait features related to falls risk are extracted. By training these features, classification hypotheses are obtained based on machine learning techniques (K Nearest-neighbour, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine). Training and test accuracies with sensitivity and specificity of each of these techniques are assessed. The feature adjustment and tuning of the machine learning algorithms are discussed.

{"abstract":"Falls are a major health risk that diminish the quality of life among elderly people. Apart from falls themselves, most dramatic consequences are usually related with long lying periods that can cause serious side effects. These findings call for pervasive long-term fall detection systems able to automatically detect falls. In this paper, we propose an effective fall detection algorithm for mobile platforms. Using data retrieved from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs) and\/or SmartPhones (SPs), our algorithm is able to detect falls using features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope. While mostly of the mobile-based solutions for fall management deal only with accelerometer data, in the proposed approach we combine the instantaneous acceleration magnitude vector with changes of the user's heading in a Threshold Based Algorithm (TBA). In such a way, we were able to handle falls detection with minimal computational load, increasing the overall system accuracy with respect to traditional fall management methods. Experimental results show the strong detection performance of the proposed solution in discriminating between falls and typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) presenting fall-like acceleration patterns.

{"abstract":"Neural activity is known to correlate with decrements in task performance as individuals enter the state of mental fatigue which might lead to lowered productivity and increased safety risks. Incorporating a passive brain computer interface (BCI) technique that detects changes in subject's neural activity and predicts the behavioral performance when the subject is underperforming might be a promising approach to reduce human error in real-world situations. Here, we developed a reliable model using EEG power spectrum to estimate time-on-task performance in a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) which can fit across individuals. High correlation between the estimated and actual reaction time was achieved. Hence, our results illustrate the feasibility for modeling time-on-task decrements in performance among different individuals from their brainwave activity, with potential applications in several domains, including traffic and industrial safety.

{"abstract":"Falls are the leading causes of unintentional injuries in the elderly and thus a pose a major hazard to our ageing society. We present the FOHEPO (FOot HEight POsitioning) system to measure, diagnose and eventually rehabilitate ageing-related neurological causes of falls. We hypothesise that both perceptual and motor variability is likely to increase with age and may lead to imprecise perception and movements causing trip overs, the major triggers of falls. Our robotic experimental system automatically measures and tracks different sources of noise in the nervous system: visual perception noise of obstacle height, proprioceptive noise of localising raising one's foot to a desired height, noise in the visual feedback of the foot movements. We developed age-appropriate psychophysical measurement protocols shorter than standard protocols for perceptual and motor accuracy. These quantify individual subjects perceptual and movement accuracy thresholds through their psychometric curves. Therefore, these platform measurements will enable us to estimate fall probabilities quantitatively, i.e. the chance that a foot will clip an obstacle because subjects did not add a sufficient safety factor when clearing it. Potentially, we can use our FOHEPO system in a game-ified setting to rehabilitate elderly users to move with larger safety factors so as to reduce their risks of trip-over.

{"abstract":"Falls are a major problem for older adults. A continuous gait monitoring that provides fall risk assessment would allow timely interventions aiming for preventing falls. The objective of this work was to find out whether gait variables calculated from the acceleration signal measured during walk task in the baseline assessment can predict changes in commonly used fall risk assessment scales after 12 months follow-up. Forty two subjects were measured during walk test with a triaxial acceleration sensor worn on a waist belt at the lower back near the centre of mass. The fall risk was assessed using a test protocol, which included several assessment methods. Gait analysis was able to predict a decline in ABC, BBS and GDS total scores and slower time in STS-5 after twelve-months follow-up.

{"abstract":"Falling in elderly is a worldwide major problem because it can lead to severe injuries, and even sudden death. Fall risk prediction would provide rapid intervention, as well as reducing the over burden of healthcare systems. Such prediction is currently performed by means of clinical scales. Among them, the Tinetti Scale is one of the better established and mostly used in clinical practice. In this work, we proposed an automatic method to assess the Tinetti scores using a wearable accelerometer. The balance and gait characteristics of 13 elderly subjects have been scored by an expert clinician while performing 8 different motor tasks according to the Tinetti Scale protocol. Two statistical analysis were selected. First, a linear regression study was performed between the Tinetti scores and 8 features (one feature for each task). Second, the generalization quality of the regression model was assessed using a Leave-One SubjectOut approach. The multiple linear regression provided a high correlation between the Tinetti scores and the features proposed (adj. R(2) = 0.948; p = 0.003).

{"abstract":"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death globally, and is notably a significant cause of death amongst young people. A suicide outcome is a complex combination of personal, social, and health factors, and therefore suicide prevention is a challenge, requiring a systems approach incorporating public health strategies, screening at-risk individuals, targeted interventions, and follow-up for suicide survivors and those bereaved by suicide. Engineering practice has been implicated in the hindrance of the adoption of suicide prevention strategies, such as installing safety barriers at the Golden Gate Bridge, however technological developments offer new opportunities in suicide prevention, and the potential to reduce the number of deaths by suicide. We present an overview of current technological developments which are facilitating research in the field of suicide prevention, including multiple modes of screening such as network analysis of mobile-phone collected connectivity data, automatic detection of suicidality from social media content, and crisis detection from acoustic variability in speech patterns. The current field of mhealth apps for suicide prevention is assessed, and an innovative app for an Indigenous population is presented.

In this study, 4 children suffering from acquired brain injury (ABI) underwent a 5 session treatment with GRAIL, to improve walking and balance ability in engaging VR environments. The first and the last sessions were partially dedicated to gait evaluation. RESULTS are promising: improvements were recorded at the ankle level, selectively at the affected side, and at the pelvic level, while small changes were measured at the hip and knee joints, which were already comparable to healthy subjects. All these changes also conveyed advances in the symmetry of the walking pattern.

{"abstract":"This project developed and evaluated a smartphone-based system to improve mobility and transportation access for the cognitively impaired. The proposed system is intended to allow the cognitively impaired to use public transportation systems, community transportation and dedicated transportation services for the disabled with greater ease and safety. Individuals with cognitive disabilities are often unable to operate an automobile, or may require a prolonged recovery period before resuming driving. Public transportation systems represent a significant means to allow these individuals to maintain independence. Yet public transportation systems can pose significant challenges to individuals with cognitive impairment. The goal of this project is to develop a system to reduce these barriers via a technological solution consisting of components developed both for the cognitively impaired user and their caregiver or family member. The first component consists of a cognitive prosthetic device featuring traditional memory cueing and reminders as well as custom location-based transportation specific functions. This cognitive mobility assistant will leverage the computing power and GPS location determination capabilities of inexpensive, powerful smart phones. The second component consists of a management application which offers caregivers the ability to configure and program the reminder and transit functions remotely via the Internet. Following completion of the prototype system a pilot human test was performed with cognitively disabled individuals and family members or caregivers to assess the usability and acceptability of both system components.

{"abstract":"Identifying diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting with normal appearing radiological MRI presents a significant challenge. Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify TBI participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from TBI and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the connectivity matrices. Network-based statistical analysis of the connectivity matrices was performed to identify the network differences between a representative subset of the two groups. The affected network connections provided the feature vectors for principal component analysis and subsequent classification by random forest. The validity of the approach was tested using data acquired from a total of 179 TBI patients and 146 controls participants. The analysis revealed altered connectivity within a number of intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways associated with DAI, in consensus with existing literature. A mean classification accuracy of 68.16%\u00b11.81% and mean sensitivity of 80.0%\u00b12.36% were achieved in correctly classifying the TBI patients evaluated on the subset of the participants that was not used for the statistical analysis, in a 10-fold cross-validation framework. These results highlight the potential for statistical machine learning approaches applied to structural connectomes to identify patients with diffusive axonal injury.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of traffic density and verbal tasks on takeover performance in highly automated driving. BACKGROUND: In highly automated vehicles, the driver has to occasionally take over vehicle control when approaching system limits. To ensure safety, the ability of the driver to regain control of the driving task under various driving situations and different driver states needs to be quantified. METHODS: Seventy-two participants experienced takeover situations requiring an evasive maneuver on a three-lane highway with varying traffic density (zero, 10, and 20 vehicles per kilometer). In a between-subjects design, half of the participants were engaged in a verbal 20-Questions Task, representing speaking on the phone while driving in a highly automated vehicle. RESULTS: The presence of traffic in takeover situations led to longer takeover times and worse takeover quality in the form of shorter time to collision and more collisions. The 20-Questions Task did not influence takeover time but seemed to have minor effects on the takeover quality. CONCLUSIONS: For the design and evaluation of human-machine interaction in takeover situations of highly automated vehicles, the traffic state seems to play a major role, compared to the driver state, manipulated by the 20-Questions Task. APPLICATION: The present results can be used by developers of highly automated systems to appropriately design human-machine interfaces and to assess the driver's time budget for regaining control.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"We propose a business rule management system that is used to optimize the dispatchment on a mass casualty incident. Using geospatial information from available ambulances and rescue helicopters, a business rule engine calculates an optimized transportation plan for injured persons. It automatically considers special needs like ambulances equipped for baby transportation or special decontamination equipment, e.g. to deal with an accident in a chemical factory. The rules used in the system are not hardcoded; thus, it is possible to redefine them on the fly without changing the program's source code. It is possible to load and save a rule set in case of a catastrophe. Furthermore, it is possible to automatically recalculate an already planned operation if it becomes clear that the rescue vehicles assigned are needed by a person with life-threatening injuries.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To understand the interaction between haptic and verbal communication, we quantified the relative effect of verbal, haptic, and haptic-plus-verbal feedback in a collaborative virtual pointing task. BACKGROUND: Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) provide a medium for interaction among remote participants. Better understanding of the role of haptic feedback as a supplement to verbalization can improve the design of CVEs. METHODS: Thirty-six participants were randomly paired into 18 dyads to complete a 2-D pointing task in a CVE. In a mixed experimental design, participants completed the task in three communication conditions: haptic only (H), verbal only (V), and haptic plus verbal (HV). The order of the conditions presented to the participants was counterbalanced. RESULTS: The time to task completion, path length, overshoot, and root mean square error were analyzed. Overall, performance in the V and HV conditions was significantly better than in the H condition. H was the least efficient communication channel but elicited response with the shortest reaction time. When verbalization was not available, the use of the haptic device was more likely to be exaggerated to ensure information transmission. When verbalization was used, participants converged on the use of a Cartesian coordinate system for communicating spatial information. CONCLUSION: Haptic communication can be used to complete a collaborative virtual task but is less efficient than verbal communication. A training period may help to improve the efficiency of haptic communication. APPLICATION: These results can be used to design remote collaboration tasks incorporating haptic components and for improving the design of CVEs that support haptic communication.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: An experiment used the workload capacity measure C(t) to quantify the processing efficiency of human-automation teams and identify operators' automation usage strategies in a speeded decision task. BACKGROUND: Although response accuracy rates and related measures are often used to measure the influence of an automated decision aid on human performance, aids can also influence response speed. Mean response times (RTs), however, conflate the influence of the human operator and the automated aid on team performance and may mask changes in the operator's performance strategy under aided conditions. The present study used a measure of parallel processing efficiency, or workload capacity, derived from empirical RT distributions as a novel gauge of human-automation performance and automation dependence in a speeded task. METHOD: Participants performed a speeded probabilistic decision task with and without the assistance of an automated aid. RT distributions were used to calculate two variants of a workload capacity measure, COR(t) and CAND(t). RESULTS: Capacity measures gave evidence that a diagnosis from the automated aid speeded human participants' responses, and that participants did not moderate their own decision times in anticipation of diagnoses from the aid. CONCLUSION AND APPLICATION: Workload capacity provides a sensitive and informative measure of human-automation performance and operators' automation dependence in speeded tasks.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We explored the dual-task costs of climbers performing a visual communication task using a head-mounted display (HMD) while simultaneously climbing along a vertical surface. BACKGROUND: Climbing is affected by secondary auditory cognitive tasks, and climbing impairs later recall of secondary task information; the effects of visually presented tasks are less clear. Given that HMDs are projected to be adopted into emergency response work, questions are raised about the effects of HMD use during climbing or other physical tasks. METHOD: Climbers performed five conditions-a climbing-only condition, two dual-task climbing conditions (words presented on the HMD with and without auditory warnings while climbing), and two seated control conditions (words presented on the HMD with and without auditory warnings)-in a repeated-measures design. Motion data were also collected to examine participant motion around word presentation. RESULTS: We found a decrease in both climbing performance and word recall under dual-task conditions, paralleling results found in previous research using auditory tasks. Participants slowed around word presentations on the HMD. Additional comparisons to previous research indicate that physical tasks may be more detrimental to word recall than are seated tasks and that visual stimuli might hinder climbing performance more than do audible stimuli. CONCLUSION: Complex physical activity, like climbing, is disruptive to memory rehearsal and later recall, and cognitive tasks disrupt physical performance. APPLICATION: Avoiding cognitive HMD tasks requiring later recall during complex physical activity is advisable. However, these systems may be developed to provide intelligent assistance, or memory augmentation, in these settings. Language: en","authors":["Alexander Woodham","Mark Billinghurst","William S.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The feasibility of measuring drivers' automation trust via gaze behavior during highly automated driving was assessed with eye tracking and validated with self-reported automation trust in a driving simulator study. BACKGROUND: Earlier research from other domains indicates that drivers' automation trust might be inferred from gaze behavior, such as monitoring frequency. METHOD: The gaze behavior and self-reported automation trust of 35 participants attending to a visually demanding non-driving-related task (NDRT) during highly automated driving was evaluated. The relationship between dispositional, situational, and learned automation trust with gaze behavior was compared. RESULTS: Overall, there was a consistent relationship between drivers' automation trust and gaze behavior. Participants reporting higher automation trust tended to monitor the automation less frequently. Further analyses revealed that higher automation trust was associated with lower monitoring frequency of the automation during NDRTs, and an increase in trust over the experimental session was connected with a decrease in monitoring frequency. CONCLUSION: We suggest that (a) the current results indicate a negative relationship between drivers' self-reported automation trust and monitoring frequency, (b) gaze behavior provides a more direct measure of automation trust than other behavioral measures, and (c) with further refinement, drivers' automation trust during highly automated driving might be inferred from gaze behavior.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perception of risk of low-back injury of individuals from four groups: office\/administrative employees, dental workers (dentists\/dental hygienists), firefighters, and undergraduate students. BACKGROUND: The concept of worker's perception of injury risk has been used to set safe material-handling limits and to determine compliance with health and safety regulations but has not been used to identify perceptual differences among occupations or potential deficiencies in risk awareness. METHOD: Participants (N = 232) were presented with eight images of different low-back postures\/tasks and were required to rate their perceived magnitude of low-back risk on a scale from 0 (no risk) to 10 (extreme risk). RESULTS: Office\/administrative and dental workers rated postures higher than firefighters and students. Individuals from all groups perceived kyphotic postures as having a higher low-back risk than lordotic postures. Further, office and dental workers, compared to firefighters and students, perceived sitting postures to have a relatively higher level of risk, likely due to these postures being typically adopted by these individuals at work. No relationship between previous low-back pain and risk rating was observed in this study. CONCLUSION: Low-back injury risk perception varies between occupations\/groups and may be a result of different exposures.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the potential benefits and impact on pilot behavior from the use of portable weather applications. METHOD: Seventy general aviation (GA) pilots participated in the study. Each pilot was randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group and flew a simulated single-engine GA aircraft, initially under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The experimental group was equipped with a portable weather application during flight. We recorded measures for weather situation awareness (WSA), decision making, cognitive engagement, and distance from the aircraft to hazardous weather. RESULTS: We found positive effects from the use of the portable weather application, with an increased WSA for the experimental group, which resulted in credibly larger route deviations and credibly greater distances to hazardous weather (\u226530 dBZ cells) compared with the control group. Nevertheless, both groups flew less than 20 statute miles from hazardous weather cells, thus failing to follow current weather-avoidance guidelines. We also found a credibly higher cognitive engagement (prefrontal oxygenation levels) for the experimental group, possibly reflecting increased flight planning and decision making on the part of the pilots. CONCLUSION: Overall, the study outcome supports our hypothesis that portable weather displays can be used without degrading pilot performance on safety-related flight tasks, actions, and decisions as measured within the constraints of the present study. However, it also shows that an increased WSA does not automatically translate to enhanced flight behavior.

{"abstract":"The authors have been continuously researching tactile walking surface indicators and audible pedestrian signals used for crossing intersections. A pedestrian walks to the opposite side of the crosswalk using audible pedestrian signals. The position where the audible pedestrian signal is set up clearly influences the pedestrian's path. We performed an intersection crossing experiment with road noise for different positions where the audible pedestrian signal was set up. Vehicle road noise is thought to influence walking pedestrians. However, we could not clearly separate the difference of where the audible pedestrian signal was set up from the influence of the road noise. We therefore conducted the experiment with no road noise in the intersection to determine the difference of the position where the audible pedestrian signal was set up.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our study investigates whether trajectory uncertainty moderates the relationship between traffic conflict and workload. Furthermore, we examine if the indirect effect of traffic density on workload through traffic conflict is conditional on the presence of trajectory uncertainty. BACKGROUND: Although it is widely accepted that uncertainty related to the future trajectory of an aircraft impacts air traffic controller decision making, little is known about how the presence of trajectory uncertainty impacts controller workload. A better understanding of the impact on controller workload can improve workload prediction models for en route air traffic control. METHOD: We collected data in a live operation environment, including workload ratings based on over-the-shoulder observations and real-time sector data. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Trajectory uncertainty interacts with traffic conflict in such a way that the positive relationship between traffic conflict and workload is strongest in the presence of trajectory uncertainty. Furthermore, we found that the mediating effect of traffic density through traffic conflict is conditional on the presence of trajectory uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that workload prediction tools that do not incorporate trajectory uncertainty may underestimate workload under conditions of trajectory uncertainty, leading to possible overload situations of air traffic controllers. APPLICATION: Sources that generate trajectory uncertainty, as well as their interaction effects with dynamic complexity metrics, should be acknowledged in workload prediction models to increase the predictive power of these models.

{"abstract":"Collision checking is considered to be the most expensive computational bottleneck in sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We introduce a simple procedure that theoretically eliminates this bottleneck and significantly reduces collision-checking time in practice in several test scenarios. Whenever a point is collision checked in the normal (expensive) way, we store a lower bound on that point's distance to the nearest obstacle. The latter is called a \"safety certificate\" and defines a region of the search space that is guaranteed to be collision-free. New points may forgo collision checking whenever they are located within a safety certificate of an old point. Testing the latter condition is accomplished during the nearest-neighbor search that is already part of most sampling-based motion planning algorithms. As more and more points are sampled, safety certificates asymptotically cover the search space and the amortized complexity of (normal, expensive) collision checking becomes negligible with respect to the overall runtime of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Indeed, the expected fraction of points requiring a normal collision check approaches zero, in the limit, as the total number of points approaches infinity. A number of extensions to the basic idea are presented. Experiments with a number of proof-of-concept implementations demonstrate that using safety certificates can improve the performance of sampling-based motion planning algorithms in practice.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and test a new dynamic measure of transient changes to the useful field of view (UFOV), utilizing a gaze-contingent paradigm for use in realistic simulated environments. BACKGROUND: The UFOV, the area from which an observer can extract visual information during a single fixation, has been correlated with driving performance and crash risk. However, some existing measures of the UFOV cannot be used dynamically in realistic simulators, and other UFOV measures involve constant stimuli at fixed locations. We propose a gaze-contingent UFOV measure (the GC-UFOV) that solves the above problems. METHODS: Twenty-five participants completed four simulated drives while they concurrently performed an occasional gaze-contingent Gabor orientation discrimination task. Gabors appeared randomly at one of three retinal eccentricities (5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, or 15\u00b0). Cognitive workload was manipulated both with a concurrent auditory working memory task and with driving task difficulty (via presence\/absence of lateral wind). RESULTS: Cognitive workload had a detrimental effect on Gabor discrimination accuracy at all three retinal eccentricities. Interestingly, this accuracy cost was equivalent across eccentricities, consistent with previous findings of \"general interference\" rather than \"tunnel vision.\" CONCLUSION: The results showed that the GC-UFOV method was able to measure transient changes in UFOV due to cognitive load in a realistic simulated environment. APPLICATION: The GC-UFOV paradigm developed and tested in this study is a novel and effective tool for studying transient changes in the UFOV due to cognitive load in the context of complex real-world tasks such as simulated driving.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To honor Tom Waters's work on emerging occupational health issues, we review the literature on physical along with chemical exposures and their impact on functional outcomes. BACKGROUND: Many occupations present the opportunity for exposure to multiple hazardous exposures, including both physical and chemical factors. However, little is known about how these different factors affect functional ability and injury. The goal of this review is to examine the relationships between these exposures, impairment of the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems, functional outcomes, and health problems with a focus on acute injury. METHOD: Literature was identified using online databases, including PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Google Scholar. References from included articles were searched for additional relevant articles. RESULTS: This review documented the limited existing literature that discussed cognitive impairment and functional disorders via neurotoxicity for physical exposures (heat and repetitive loading) and chemical exposures (pesticides, volatile organic compounds [VOCs], and heavy metals). CONCLUSION: This review supports that workers are exposed to physical and chemical exposures that are associated with negative health effects, including functional impairment and injury. Innovation in exposure assessment with respect to quantifying the joint exposure to these different exposures is especially needed for developing risk assessment models and, ultimately, preventive measures. APPLICATION: Along with physical exposures, chemical exposures need to be considered, alone and in combination, in assessing functional ability and occupationally related injuries.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand factors that influence the prediction of uncertain spatial trajectories (e.g., the future path of a hurricane or ship) and the role of human overconfidence in such prediction. BACKGROUND: Research has indicated that human prediction of uncertain trajectories is difficult and may well be subject to overconfidence in the accuracy of forecasts as is found in event prediction, a finding that indicates that humans insufficiently appreciate the contributions of variance in nature to their predictions. METHOD: In two experiments, our paradigm required participants to observe a starting point, a position at time T, and then make a prediction of the location of the trajectory at time NT. They experienced several trajectories from the same underlying model but perturbed by random variance in heading and speed. RESULTS: In Experiment 1A, people predicted linear paths well and were better in heading predictions than in speed predictions. However, participants greatly underestimated the variance in predicted location, indicating overconfidence. In Experiment 1B, the effect was replicated with frequencies rather than probabilities used in variance estimates. In Experiment 2, people predicted nonlinear trajectories poorly, and overconfidence was again observed. Overconfidence was reduced on the more difficult predictions. In both main experiments, those better at predicting the mean were not better at predicting the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting the level of uncertainty in spatial trajectories is not well done and may involve qualitatively different abilities than prediction of the mean. APPLICATION: Improving real-world performance at prediction demands developing better understanding of variability, not just the average case. Biases in prediction of uncertainty may be addressed through debiasing training and\/or visualization tools that could assist in more calibrated action planning.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated performance, workload, and stress in groups of paired observers who performed a vigilance task in a coactive (independent) manner. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that groups of coactive observers detect more signals in a vigilance task than observers working alone. Therefore, the use of such groups might be effective in enhancing signal detection in operational situations. However, concern over appearing less competent than one's cohort might induce elevated levels of workload and stress in coactive group members and thereby undermine group performance benefits. Accordingly, we performed the initial experiment comparing workload and stress in observers who performed a vigilance task coactively with those of observers who performed the vigilance task alone. METHOD: Observers monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle control task. Self-reports of workload and stress were secured via the NASA-Task Load Index and the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Groups of coactive observers detected significantly more signals than did single observers. Coacting observers did not differ significantly from those operating by themselves in terms of workload but did in regard to stress; posttask distress was significantly lower for coacting than for single observers. CONCLUSION: Performing a visual vigilance task in a coactive manner with another observer does not elevate workload above that of observers working alone and serves to attenuate the stress associated with vigilance task performance. APPLICATION: The use of coacting observers could be an effective vehicle for enhancing performance efficiency in operational vigilance.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Road safety barriers are roadside structures installed on certain sections of the road to improve highway safety by preventing a vehicle from leaving the road and colliding with roadside hazards. Road safety barriers are an effective solution for reducing the risk of injuries on modern roads. A road safety barrier must meet minimum standards of construction and materials design. Normally, they must undergo crash tests according to the European standard EN 1317 or the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. On the basis of these standards, each safety barrier must pass standardized crash tests as mandated in their approval procedures. Currently, computer simulation methods are typically used by researchers to analyze the performance of roadside safety barriers. Advancement in computer technology could facilitate the finite element method in replacing expensive experimental tests. This paper presents an approach for constructing and evaluating a finite element model for road safety barriers according to European standard EN 1317 by using the finite element code LS-DYNA. Excellent agreement between real-world test data and simulation results was achieved for behavior and impact severity values. The results obtained using the model ensure the exactness of the proposed method and prove that the numerical method is a practical approach for eliminating road safety barrier problems. Furthermore, the model was able to replace experimental tests for developing road safety barriers, thus reducing time and money. Language: en","authors":["Tso-Liang Teng","Cho-Chung Liang","T. H.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have demonstrated unique driver behavior outcomes when visual and cognitive distraction occurs simultaneously as compared to the occurrence of one form of distraction alone. This situation implies additional complexity for the design of robust distraction detection systems and vehicle automation for hazard mitigation. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of two distraction classification strategies: (a) a \"two-stage\" classifier, first detecting visual-manual distraction and then identifying dual or cognitive distraction states, and (b) a \"direct-mapping\" classifier developed to identify all distraction states at the same time. METHOD: Driving performance data were collected on 20 participants under different known states of distraction (none, visual-manual, cognitive, and combined). A support vector machine (SVM) was used as a base algorithm for both classifiers and performance data as well as the level of driving control (tactical and operational), which served as inputs and modifiers to the classification process. RESULTS: The two-stage strategy was found to be sensitive for identifying states of visual-manual distraction; however, the strategy also produced a higher false alarm rate than direct-mapping. Consideration of driving control levels during classification also improved classification accuracy. Future work needs to account for strategic levels of vehicle control.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. Language: en","authors":["Yu Zhang","David B.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the nighttime conspicuity benefits of adding electroluminescent (EL) panels to pedestrian clothing that contains retroreflective elements. BACKGROUND: Researchers have repeatedly documented that pedestrians are too often not sufficiently conspicuous to drivers at night and that retroreflective materials can enhance the conspicuity of pedestrians. However, because retroreflective elements in clothing are effective only when they are illuminated by the headlamps of an approaching driver, they are not useful for pedestrians who are positioned outside the beam pattern of an approaching vehicle's headlamps. Electroluminescent materials-flexible luminous panels that can be attached to clothing-have the potential to be well suited for these conditions. METHOD: Using an open-road course at night, we compared the distances at which observers responded to pedestrians who were positioned at one of three lateral positions (relative to the vehicle's path) wearing one of two high-visibility garments. RESULTS: The garment that included both EL and retroreflective materials yielded longer response distances than the retroreflective-only garment. This effect was particularly strong when the test pedestrian was positioned farthest outside of the area illuminated by headlamps. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EL materials can further enhance the conspicuity of pedestrians who are wearing retroreflective materials. APPLICATION: EL materials can be applied to garments. They may be especially valuable to enhance the conspicuity of roadway workers, emergency responders, and traffic control officers.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to (a) describe the development and application of an automated approach for processing in-vehicle speech data from a naturalistic driving study (NDS), (b) examine the influence of child passenger presence on driving performance, and (c) model this relationship using in-vehicle speech data. BACKGROUND: Parent drivers frequently engage in child-related secondary behaviors, but the impact on driving performance is unknown. Applying automated speech-processing techniques to NDS audio data would facilitate the analysis of in-vehicle driver-child interactions and their influence on driving performance. METHOD: Speech activity detection and speaker diarization algorithms were applied to audio data from a Melbourne-based NDS involving 42 families. Multilevel models were developed to evaluate the effect of speech activity and the presence of child passengers on driving performance. RESULTS: Speech activity was significantly associated with velocity and steering angle variability. Child passenger presence alone was not associated with changes in driving performance. However, speech activity in the presence of two child passengers was associated with the most variability in driving performance. CONCLUSION: The effects of in-vehicle speech on driving performance in the presence of child passengers appear to be heterogeneous, and multiple factors may need to be considered in evaluating their impact. This goal can potentially be achieved within large-scale NDS through the automated processing of observational data, including speech. APPLICATION: Speech-processing algorithms enable new perspectives on driving performance to be gained from existing NDS data, and variables that were once labor-intensive to process can be readily utilized in future research.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to determine whether detection of the onset of a lead car's deceleration and judgments of its time to contact (TTC) were affected by the presence of vehicles in lanes adjacent to the lead car. BACKGROUND: In a previous study, TTC judgments of an approaching object by a stationary observer were influenced by an adjacent task-irrelevant approaching object. The implication is that vehicles in lanes adjacent to a lead car could influence a driver's ability to detect the lead car's deceleration and to make judgments of its TTC. METHOD: Displays simulated car-following scenes in which two vehicles in adjacent lanes were either present or absent. Participants were instructed to respond as soon as the lead car decelerated (Experiment 1) or when they thought their car would hit the decelerating lead car (Experiment 2). RESULTS: The presence of adjacent vehicles did not affect response time to detect deceleration of a lead car but did affect the signal detection theory measure of sensitivity d' and the number of missed deceleration events. Judgments of the lead car's TTC were shorter when adjacent vehicles were present and decelerated early than when adjacent vehicles were absent. CONCLUSION: The presence of vehicles in nearby lanes can affect a driver's ability to detect a lead car's deceleration and to make subsequent judgments of its TTC. APPLICATION: Results suggest that nearby traffic can affect a driver's ability to accurately judge a lead car's motion in situations that pose risk for rear-end collisions.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Modulation of selective attention appears to be under the guidance of a cluster of distinct task-control networks, the frontroparietal (FPN) and cingulo-opercular (CON). Yet, their role in mediating the relationship between task perceptual load and presence\/absence of distraction in the auditory modality is unclear. Here, we examined this interaction using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an auditory signal detection task. The auditory stimulus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was parametrically manipulated, by varying the amplitude of the Tone while holding the Noise constant, to create four perceptual load conditions presented in combination with or without acoustic distraction. Regions of the FPN (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule) and CON (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\/medial superior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, anterior insula\/frontal operculum) were modulated by perceptual load and distraction, such that lower loads induced a pattern of increased activity when there was no distraction. On the other hand, a trend of augmented activity was found in higher loads during distraction. These findings suggest a role for the FPN and CON in mediating the allocation of attentional resources to competing auditory information under varying degrees of perceptual demand.Copyright \u00a9 2015.

{"abstract":"Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is increasingly applied for the development of functional biomarkers in brain disorders. Recent studies have revealed spontaneous vigilance drifts during the resting state, involving changes in brain activity and connectivity that challenge the validity of uncontrolled rs-fMRI findings. In a combined rs-fMRI\/eye tracking study, the pupil size of 32 healthy subjects after 2h of sleep restriction was recorded as an indirect index for activity of the locus coeruleus, the brainstem's noradrenergic arousal center. The spontaneous occurrence of pupil dilations, but not pupil size per se, was associated with increased activity of the salience network, thalamus and frontoparietal regions. In turn, spontaneous constrictions of the pupil were associated with increased activity in visual and sensorimotor regions. These results were largely replicated in a sample of 36 healthy subjects who did not undergo sleep restriction, although in this sample the correlation between thalamus and pupil dilation fell below whole-brain significance. Our data show that spontaneous pupil fluctuations during rest are indeed associated with brain circuitry involved in tonic alertness and vigilance. Pupillometry is an effective method to control for changes in tonic alertness during rs-fMRI.Copyright \u00a9 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Eye tracking is commonly used in marketing to understand complex responses to materials, but has not been used to understand how low-literacy adults access health information or its relationship to decision making. METHODS: This study assessed how participants use a literacy appropriate \"dirty bomb\" decision aid. Participants were randomized to receive a CDC \"factsheet\" (n = 21) or literacy-appropriate aid (n = 29) shown on a computer screen. Using 7 content similar slides, gaze patterns, mean pupil fixation time and mean overall time reading and looking at slides were compared. Groups were also compared by literacy level and effect on 'confidence of knowledge' and intended behavior. RESULTS: Results revealed differing abilities to read densely written material. Intervention participants more precisely followed text on 4 of 7 content-similar slides compared to control participants whose gaze patterns indicated unread text, or repeated attempts at reading the same text, suggesting difficulty in understanding key preparedness messages. Controls had significantly longer pupil fixations on 5 of 7 slides and spent more overall time on every slide. In those with very low literacy, intervention participants were more likely than controls to say they understood what a \"dirty bomb\" is and how to respond if one should occur. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate limited- literacy adults, especially those with very low literacy, may not be able to understand how to respond during a \"dirty bomb\" using available materials, making them vulnerable to negative health events. This study provides insights into how individuals perceive and process risk communication messages, illustrating a rich and nuanced understanding of the qualitative experience of a limited literacy population with written materials. It also demonstrates the feasibility of using these methods on a wider scale to develop more effective health and risk communication messages designed to increase knowledge of and compliance with general health guidelines, and enhance decision making. This has application for those with learning disabilities, those with limited media-literacy skills, and those needing to access the diverse array of assistive technologies now available. Eye tracking is thus a practical approach to understanding these diverse needs to ensure the development of cogent and salient communication. Language: en","authors":["Sarah Bauerle Bass","Thomas F.

{"abstract":"An important question about eye-movement behavior is when the decision is made to terminate a fixation and program the following saccade. Different approaches have found converging evidence in favor of a mixed-control account, in which there is some overlap between processing information at fixation and planning the following saccade. We examined one interesting instance of mixed control in visual search: lag-2 revisits, during which observers fixate a stimulus, move to a different stimulus, and then revisit the first stimulus on the next fixation. RESULTS show that the probability of lag-2 revisits occurring increased with the number of target-similar stimuli, and revisits were preceded by a brief fixation on the intervening distractor stimulus. We developed the Efficient Visual Sampling (EVS) computational model to simulate our findings (fixation durations and fixation locations) and to provide insight into mixed control of fixations and the perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that produce lag-2 revisits.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Based on the line operations safety audit (LOSA), two studies were conducted to develop and deploy an equivalent tool for aircraft maintenance: the maintenance operations safety survey (MOSS). BACKGROUND: Safety in aircraft maintenance is currently measured reactively, based on the number of audit findings, reportable events, incidents, or accidents. Proactive safety tools designed for monitoring routine operations, such as flight data monitoring and LOSA, have been developed predominantly for flight operations. METHOD: In Study 1, development of MOSS, 12 test peer-to-peer observations were collected to investigate the practicalities of this approach. In Study 2, deployment of MOSS, seven expert observers collected 56 peer-to-peer observations of line maintenance checks at four stations. Narrative data were coded and analyzed according to the threat and error management (TEM) framework. RESULTS: In Study 1, a line check was identified as a suitable unit of observation. Communication and third-party data management were the key factors in gaining maintainer trust. Study 2 identified that on average, maintainers experienced 7.8 threats (operational complexities) and committed 2.5 errors per observation. The majority of threats and errors were inconsequential. Links between specific threats and errors leading to 36 undesired states were established. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that observations of routine maintenance operations are feasible. TEM-based results highlight successful management strategies that maintainers employ on a day-to-day basis. APPLICATION: MOSS is a novel approach for safety data collection and analysis. It helps practitioners understand the nature of maintenance errors, promote an informed culture, and support safety management systems in the maintenance domain.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Older adults show decrements in the ability to ignore or suppress distraction relative to younger adults. However, age differences in the neural correlates of distraction control and the role of large-scale network interaction in regulating distractors are scarcely examined. In the current study, we investigated age differences in how the anticorrelation between an externally oriented dorsal attention network (DAN) and an internally focused default mode network (DMN) is related to inhibiting distractors presented during a 1-back working memory task. For both young and older adults, the extent of DAN-DMN anticorrelation predicted reduced distractibility. Activation in a common set of frontal and insular control regions during the task was, however, associated with opposite patterns of network interaction and distractibility in the age groups. For older adults, recruitment of these regions was associated with greater DAN-DMN anticorrelation and less distractibility (better performance). For younger adults, it was associated with decreased DAN-DMN anticorrelation and more distractibility (worse performance). Our findings demonstrate the age-dependent relationship between DAN-DMN interaction patterns and engagement of control regions during an externally oriented distraction control task. This suggests that engagement of those regions may play a compensatory role for older adults but may be indicative of less efficient neural control mechanisms in younger adults.Copyright \u00a9 2016.

{"abstract":"Risk attitude is often regarded as an intrinsic parameter in the individual personality. However, ethological studies reported state-dependent strategy optimization irrespective of individual preference. To synthesize the two contrasting literatures, we developed a novel gambling task that dynamically manipulated the quota severity (required outcome to clear the task) in a course of choice trials and conducted a task-fMRI study in human participants. The participants showed their individual risk preference when they had no quota constraint ('individual-preference mode'), while they adopted state-dependent optimal strategy when they needed to achieve a quota ('strategy-optimization mode'). fMRI analyses illustrated that the interplay among prefrontal areas and salience-network areas reflected the quota severity and the utilization of the optimal strategy, shedding light on the neural substrates of the quota-dependent risk attitude. Our results demonstrated the complex nature of risk-sensitive decision-making and may provide a new perspective for the understanding of problematic risky behaviors in human.Copyright \u00a9 2016.

{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Older people generally prefer to continue living in their own homes rather than move into residential age care institutions. Assistive technologies and sensors in the home environment and\/or bodily worn systems that monitor people's movement might contribute to an increased sense of safety and security at home. However, their use can raise ethical anxieties as little is known about how older persons perceive assistive and monitoring technologies. OBJECTIVES: To review the main barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies (ATs) by older adults in order to uncover issues of concern from empirical studies and to arrange these issues from the most critical to the least critical. METHOD: A 4-step systematic review was conducted using empirical studies: locating and identifying relevant articles; screening of located articles; examination of full text articles for inclusion\/exclusion; and detail examination of the 44 articles included. RESULTS: Privacy is a top critical concern to older adults, registering a 34% of the total articles examined. Two other equally potent barriers to the adoption of ATs were trust and functionality\/added value representing 27 and 25 per cent each respectively of the total studies examined. Also of serious concerns are cost of ATs and ease of use and suitability for daily use (23%) each respectively, perception of \"no need\" (20%), stigma (18%), and fear of dependence and lack of training (16%) each respectively. These underlying factors are generation\/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies such as the so-called \"gerontechnologies\" specifically targeting older adults. However, more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ATs in order to fit in with the society. CONCLUSIONS: The identified underlying factors are generation\/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. The negative attitudes that are most frequently associated with technologies such as the so-called \"gerontechnologies\" specifically targeting older adults contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them.Copyright \u00a9 2016.

{"abstract":"The very expertise with which psychologists wield their tools for achieving laboratory control may have had the unwelcome effect of blinding psychologists to the possibilities of discovering principles of behavior without conducting experiments. When creatively interrogated, a diverse range of large, real-world data sets provides powerful diagnostic tools for revealing principles of human judgment, perception, categorization, decision-making, language use, inference, problem solving, and representation. Examples of these data sets include patterns of website links, dictionaries, logs of group interactions, collections of images and image tags, text corpora, history of financial transactions, trends in twitter tag usage and propagation, patents, consumer product sales, performance in high-stakes sporting events, dialect maps, and scientific citations. The goal of this issue is to present some exemplary case studies of mining naturally existing data sets to reveal important principles and phenomena in cognitive science, and to discuss some of the underlying issues involved with conducting traditional experiments, analyses of naturally occurring data, computational modeling, and the synthesis of all three methods.\u00a9 2016 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the human-automation interaction issues and the interacting factors in the context of conflict detection and resolution advisory (CRA) systems. BACKGROUND: The issues of imperfect automation in air traffic control (ATC) have been well documented in previous studies, particularly in conflict-alerting systems. The extent to which the prior findings can be applied to an integrated conflict detection and resolution system in future ATC remains unknown. METHOD: Twenty-four participants were evenly divided into two groups corresponding to a medium- and a high-traffic density condition, respectively. In each traffic density condition, participants were instructed to perform simulated ATC tasks under four automation conditions, including reliable, unreliable with short time allowance to secondary conflict (TAS), unreliable with long TAS, and manual conditions. Dependent variables accounted for conflict resolution performance, workload, situation awareness, and trust in and dependence on the CRA aid, respectively. RESULTS: Imposing the CRA automation did increase performance and reduce workload as compared with manual performance. The CRA aid did not decrease situation awareness. The benefits of the CRA aid were manifest even when it was imperfectly reliable and were apparent across traffic loads. In the unreliable blocks, trust in the CRA aid was degraded but dependence was not influenced, yet the performance was not adversely affected. CONCLUSION: The use of CRA aid would benefit ATC operations across traffic densities. APPLICATION: CRA aid offers benefits across traffic densities, regardless of its imperfection, as long as its reliability level is set above the threshold of assistance, suggesting its application for future ATC.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Human gait is mainly related to the foot and leg movements but, obviously, the entire motor system of the human body is involved. We hypothesise that movement parameters such as dynamic balance, movement harmony of each body element (arms, head, thorax \u2026) could enable us to finely characterise gait singularities to pinpoint potential diseases or abnormalities in advance. Since this paper deals with the preliminary problem pertaining to the classification of normal and abnormal gait, our study will revolve around the lower part of the body. Our proposal presents a functional specification of gait in which only observational kinematic aspects are discussed. The resultant specification will confidently be open enough to be applied to a variety of gait analysis problems encountered in areas connected to rehabilitation, sports, children's motor skills, and so on. To carry out our functional specification, we develop an extraction system through which we analyse image sequences to identify gait features. Our prototype not only readily lets us determine the dynamic parameters (heel strike, toe off, stride length and time) and some skeleton joints but also satisfactorily supplies us with a proper distinction between normal and abnormal gait.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal for this study was to develop an English translation of the Attention-Related Driving Errors Scale (ARDES-US) and to determine its potential relationship with driver history and other demographic variables. BACKGROUND: Individual differences in performance on vigilance and cognitive tasks are well documented, but less is known about susceptibility to attention-related errors while driving. The ARDES has been developed and administered in both Spanish and Chinese but to our knowledge has never been administered or examined in an English-speaking population. METHOD: Two hundred ninety-six English-speaking individuals completed a series of self-report measures, including the ARDES-US, Attention-Related Cognitive Errors Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire. RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis using maximum-likelihood estimates with robust standard errors revealed results largely consistent with previous versions of the ARDES, namely, the ARDES-Spain and ARDES-Argentina. Additionally, a number of new results emerged. Specifically, women, drivers who received traffic tickets within the previous 2 years, and those with a lower level of education all had a greater propensity toward self-reported driver inattention as measured by the ARDES-US. Further analyses revealed that these findings were independent of age, years of driving experience, and driving frequency. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the ARDES-US is a valid and reliable measure of driver inattention with an English-speaking American sample. APPLICATION: Potential applications of the ARDES-US include identifying individuals who are at greater risk of attention-related errors while driving and suggesting individually tailored training and safety countermeasures.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

A number of large prospective studies shows that elderly patients have significant fractures and injuries even sometimes in some cases a fall can be concluded with deaths. However, in case of fall, if the situation is noticed and aided quickly, the life quality can be increased significantly in older people.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether identifying (or ignoring) learned alarm sounds interferes with performance on a task involving working memory. BACKGROUND: A number of researchers have suggested that auditory alarms could interfere with working memory in complex task environments, and this could serve as a caution against their use. Changing auditory information has been shown to interfere with serial recall, even when the auditory information is to be ignored. However, previous researchers have not examined well-learned patterns, such as familiar alarms. METHOD: One group of participants learned a set of alarms (either a melody, a rhythmic pulse, or a spoken nonword phrase) and subsequently undertook a digits-forward task in three conditions (no alarms, identify the alarm, or ignore the alarm). A comparison group undertook the baseline and ignore conditions but had no prior exposure to the alarms. RESULTS: All alarms interfered with serial recall when participants were asked to identify them; however, only the nonword phrase interfered with recall when ignored. Moreover, there was no difference between trained and untrained participants in terms of recall performance when ignoring the alarms, suggesting that previous training does not make alarms less ignorable. CONCLUSION: Identifying any alarm sound may interfere with immediate working memory; however, spoken alarms may interfere even when ignored. APPLICATION: It is worth considering the importance of alarms in environments requiring high working memory performance and in particular avoiding spoken alarms in such environments.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Social connectedness theory posits that the brain processes social rejection as a threat to survival. Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that midfrontal theta (4-8Hz) oscillations in the EEG provide a window on the processing of social rejection. Here we examined midfrontal theta dynamics (power and inter-trial phase synchrony) during the processing of social evaluative feedback. We employed the Social Judgment paradigm in which 56 undergraduate women (mean age = 19.67 years) were asked to communicate their expectancies about being liked vs. disliked by unknown peers. Expectancies were followed by feedback indicating social acceptance vs. rejection. RESULTS revealed a significant increase in EEG theta power to unexpected social rejection feedback. This EEG theta response could be source-localized to brain regions typically reported during activation of the saliency network (i.e., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and the supplementary motor area). Theta phase dynamics mimicked the behavior of the time-domain averaged feedback-related negativity (FRN) by showing stronger phase synchrony for feedback that was unexpected vs. expected. Theta phase, however, differed from the FRN by also displaying stronger phase synchrony in response to rejection vs. acceptance feedback. Together, this study highlights distinct roles for midfrontal theta power and phase synchrony in response to social evaluative feedback. Our findings contribute to the literature by showing that midfrontal theta oscillatory power is sensitive to social rejection but only when peer rejection is unexpected, and this theta response is governed by a widely distributed neural network implicated in saliency detection and conflict monitoring.Copyright \u00a9 2016.

{"abstract":"This study presented a paradigm for controlling a car using an asynchronous electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and presented the experimental results of a simulation performed in an experimental environment outside the laboratory. This paradigm uses two distinct MI tasks, imaginary left- and right-hand movements, to generate a multi-task car control strategy consisting of starting the engine, moving forward, turning left, turning right, moving backward, and stopping the engine. Five healthy subjects participated in the online car control experiment, and all successfully controlled the car by following a previously outlined route. Subject S1 exhibited the most satisfactory BCI-based performance, which was comparable to the manual control-based performance. We hypothesize that the proposed self-paced car control paradigm based on EEG signals could potentially be used in car control applications, and we provide a complementary or alternative way for individuals with locked-in disorders to achieve more mobility in the future, as well as providing a supplementary car-driving strategy to assist healthy people in driving a car.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to (a) implement theoretical perspectives regarding human-automation interaction (HAI) into model-based tools to assist designers in developing systems that support effective performance and (b) conduct validations to assess the ability of the models to predict operator performance. BACKGROUND: Two key concepts in HAI, the lumberjack analogy and black swan events, have been studied extensively. The lumberjack analogy describes the effects of imperfect automation on operator performance. In routine operations, an increased degree of automation supports performance, but in failure conditions, increased automation results in more significantly impaired performance. Black swans are the rare and unexpected failures of imperfect automation. METHOD: The lumberjack analogy and black swan concepts have been implemented into three model-based tools that predict operator performance in different systems. These tools include a flight management system, a remotely controlled robotic arm, and an environmental process control system. RESULTS: Each modeling effort included a corresponding validation. In one validation, the software tool was used to compare three flight management system designs, which were ranked in the same order as predicted by subject matter experts. The second validation compared model-predicted operator complacency with empirical performance in the same conditions. The third validation compared model-predicted and empirically determined time to detect and repair faults in four automation conditions. CONCLUSION: The three model-based tools offer useful ways to predict operator performance in complex systems. APPLICATION: The three tools offer ways to predict the effects of different automation designs on operator performance.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This article describes a closed-loop, integrated human-vehicle model designed to help understand the underlying cognitive processes that influenced changes in subject visual attention, mental workload, and situation awareness across control mode transitions in a simulated human-in-the-loop lunar landing experiment. BACKGROUND: Control mode transitions from autopilot to manual flight may cause total attentional demands to exceed operator capacity. Attentional resources must be reallocated and reprioritized, which can increase the average uncertainty in the operator's estimates of low-priority system states. We define this increase in uncertainty as a reduction in situation awareness. METHOD: We present a model built upon the optimal control model for state estimation, the crossover model for manual control, and the SEEV (salience, effort, expectancy, value) model for visual attention. We modify the SEEV attention executive to direct visual attention based, in part, on the uncertainty in the operator's estimates of system states. RESULTS: The model was validated using the simulated lunar landing experimental data, demonstrating an average difference in the percentage of attention \u22643.6% for all simulator instruments. The model's predictions of mental workload and situation awareness, measured by task performance and system state uncertainty, also mimicked the experimental data. CONCLUSION: Our model supports the hypothesis that visual attention is influenced by the uncertainty in system state estimates. APPLICATION: Conceptualizing situation awareness around the metric of system state uncertainty is a valuable way for system designers to understand and predict how reallocations in the operator's visual attention during control mode transitions can produce reallocations in situation awareness of certain states.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

{"abstract":"Background and Objective: Abrupt accelerations or decelerations can cause large strain in brain tissues and, consequently, different forms of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). In order to predict the effect of the accelerations upon the soft tissues of the brain, many different injury metrics have been proposed (typically, an injury metric is a real valued functional of the accelerations). The objective of this article is to make a formal and empirical comparison, in order to identify general criteria for reasonable injury metrics, and propose a general guideline to avoid ill-proposed injury metrics. Methods: A medium-size sample of vehicle-pedestrian collisions, from Post Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) tests, is analyzed. A statistical study has been conducted in order to determine the discriminant power of the usual metrics. We use Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality and to check consistency among the different metrics. In addition, this article compares the mathematical properties of some of these functionals, trying to identify the desirable properties that any of those functionals needs to fulfill in order to be useful for optimization. Results: We have found a pair-wise consistency of all the currently used metrics (any two injury metrics are always positively related). In addition, we observed that two independent principal factors explain about 72.5% of the observed variance among all collision tests. This is remarkable because it indicates that despite high number of different injury metrics, a reduced number of variables can explain the results of all these metrics. With regard to the formal properties, we found that essentially all injury mechanisms can be accounted by means of scalable, differentiable and convex functionals (we propose to call minimization suitable injury metric to any metric having these three formal properties). In addition three useful functionals, usable as injury metrics, are identified on the basis of the empirical comparisons. Conclusions: The commonly used metrics are highly consistent, but also highly redundant. Formal minimal conditions of a reasonable injury metric has been identified. Future proposals of injury metrics can benefit from the results of this study. Language: en","authors":["David S\u00e1nchez-Molina","C. Arregui-Dalmases","J. Vel\u00e1zquez-Ameijide","M.

{"abstract":"Adolescence is characterized by increased risky decision-making, enhanced mesolimbic response to risk and reward, increased perceived stress, and heightened physiological response to stress relative to other age groups. In adults, evidence suggests that acute stress increases risky decision-making by stress-induced increases of dopamine in regions implicated in reward processing and decision-making. Acute stress also increases risky decision-making in adolescents, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remained unexplored. In this study, daily self-reports of stress were documented in adolescents and adults. Participants completed two fMRI visits during which they performed a risky decision-making task: once each when they endorsed a high and low level of stress. RESULTS revealed that adolescent males took more advantageous risks under high stress relative to low stress whereas adult males took fewer non-advantageous risks under high stress relative to low stress. Adolescent males also showed a stress-related decrease in prefrontal activation when making risky decisions from high stress to low stress while adult males maintained prefrontal activation when making risky decisions across stress conditions. Adolescent and adult females did not exhibit stress-related changes in risky decisions. Moreover, greater prefrontal activation under stress was associated with fewer non-advantageous risks taken under stress. Implications for risk-taking under stress are discussed in light of these findings.Copyright \u00a9 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc.

{"abstract":"Personality traits such as conscientiousness as self-reported by individuals can help predict a range of outcomes, from job performance to longevity. Asking others to rate the personality of their acquaintances often provides even better predictive power than using self-report. Here, we examine whether peer-reported personality can provide a better link between brain function, namely threat-related amygdala activity, and future health-related behavior, namely problem drinking, than self-reported personality. Using data from a sample of 377 young adult university students who were rated on five personality traits by peers, we find that higher threat-related amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions is associated with higher peer-reported, but not self-reported, conscientiousness. Moreover, higher peer-reported, but not self-reported, conscientiousness predicts lower future problem drinking more than one year later, an effect specific to men. Remarkably, relatively higher amygdala activity has an indirect effect on future drinking behavior in men, linked by peer-reported conscientiousness to lower future problem drinking. Our results provide initial evidence that the perceived conscientiousness of an individual by their peers uniquely reflects variability in a core neural mechanism supporting threat responsiveness. These novel patterns further suggest that incorporating peer-reported measures of personality into individual differences research can reveal novel predictive pathways of risk and protection for problem behaviors.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of automatic target detection (ATD) on the detection and identification performance of soldiers. BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that highlighting targets can aid their detection. We provided soldiers with ATD that was more likely to detect one target identity than another, potentially acting as an implicit identification aid. METHOD: Twenty-eight soldiers detected and identified simulated human targets in an immersive virtual environment with and without ATD. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying scene illumination (day, night). The ATD identification bias was also manipulated (hostile bias, no bias, and friendly bias). We used signal detection measures to treat the identification results. RESULTS: ATD presence improved detection performance, especially under high task difficulty (night illumination). Identification sensitivity was greater for cued than uncued targets. The identification decision criterion for cued targets varied with the ATD identification bias but showed a \"sluggish beta\" effect. CONCLUSION: ATD helps soldiers detect and identify targets. The effects of biased ATD on identification should be considered with respect to the operational context. APPLICATION: Less-than-perfectly-reliable ATD is a useful detection aid for dismounted soldiers. Disclosure of known ATD identification bias to the operator may aid the identification process.\u00a9 2016, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of National Defence.

{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To propose a driver attention theory based on the notion of driving as a satisficing and partially self-paced task and, within this framework, present a definition for driver inattention. BACKGROUND: Many definitions of driver inattention and distraction have been proposed, but they are difficult to operationalize, and they are either unreasonably strict and inflexible or suffer from hindsight bias. METHOD: Existing definitions of driver distraction are reviewed and their shortcomings identified. We then present the minimum required attention (MiRA) theory to overcome these shortcomings. Suggestions on how to operationalize MiRA are also presented. RESULTS: MiRA describes which role the attention of the driver plays in the shared \"situation awareness of the traffic system.\" A driver is considered attentive when sampling sufficient information to meet the demands of the system, namely, that he or she fulfills the preconditions to be able to form and maintain a good enough mental representation of the situation. A driver should only be considered inattentive when information sampling is not sufficient, regardless of whether the driver is concurrently executing an additional task or not. CONCLUSIONS: The MiRA theory builds on well-established driver attention theories. It goes beyond available driver distraction definitions by first defining what a driver needs to be attentive to, being free from hindsight bias, and allowing the driver to adapt to the current demands of the traffic situation through satisficing and self-pacing. MiRA has the potential to provide the stepping stone for unbiased and operationalizable inattention detection and classification.\u00a9 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.
